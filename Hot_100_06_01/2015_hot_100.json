He hurried down to the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, from which shots were being fired. At the corner of the Rue Saint-Honor\u00e9 some men in blouses ran past him, exclaiming:\n\n\"No! not that way! to the Palais-Royal!\"\n\nFrederick followed them. The grating of the Convent of the Assumption had been torn away. A little further on he noticed three paving-stones in the middle of the street, the beginning of a barricade, no doubt; then fragments of bottles and bundles of iron-wire, to obstruct the cavalry; and, at the same moment, there rushed suddenly out of a lane a tall young man of pale complexion, with his black hair flowing over his shoulders, and with a sort of pea-coloured swaddling-cloth thrown round him. In his hand he held a long military musket, and he dashed along on the tips of his slippers with the air of a somnambulist and with the nimbleness of a tiger. At intervals a detonation could be heard.\n\nOn the evening of the day before, the spectacle of the wagon containing five corpses picked up from amongst those that were lying on the Boulevard des Capucines had charged the disposition of the people; and, while at the Tuileries the aides-de-camp succeeded each other, and M. Mol\u00e9, having set about the composition of a new Cabinet, did not come back, and M. Thiers was making efforts to constitute another, and while the King was cavilling and hesitating, and finally assigned the post of commander-in-chief to Bugeaud in order to prevent him from making use of it, the insurrection was organising itself in a formidable manner, as if it were directed by a single arm.\n\nMen endowed with a kind of frantic eloquence were engaged in haranguing the populace at the street-corners, others were in the churches ringing the tocsin as loudly as ever they could. Lead was cast for bullets, cartridges were rolled about. The trees on the boulevards, the urinals, the benches, the gratings, the gas-burners, everything was torn off and thrown down. Paris, that morning, was covered with barricades. The resistance which was offered was of short duration, so that at eight o'clock the people, by voluntary surrender or by force, had got possession of five barracks, nearly all the municipal buildings, the most favourable strategic points. Of its own accord, without any effort, the Monarchy was melting away in rapid dissolution, and now an attack was made on the guard-house of the Ch\u00e2teau d'Eau, in order to liberate fifty prisoners, who were not there.\n\nFrederick was forced to stop at the entrance to the square. It was filled with groups of armed men. The Rue Saint-Thomas and the Rue Fromanteau were occupied by companies of the Line. The Rue de Valois was choked up by an enormous barricade. The smoke which fluttered about at the top of it partly opened. Men kept running overhead, making violent gestures; they vanished from sight; then the firing was again renewed. It was answered from the guard-house without anyone being seen inside. Its windows, protected by oaken window-shutters, were pierced with loop-holes; and the monument with its two storys, its two wings, its fountain on the first floor and its little door in the centre, was beginning to be speckled with white spots under the shock of the bullets. The three steps in front of it remained unoccupied.\n\nAt Frederick's side a man in a Greek cap, with a cartridge-box over his knitted vest, was holding a dispute with a woman with a Madras neckerchief round her shoulders. She said to him:\n\n\"Come back now! Come back!\"\n\n\"Leave me alone!\" replied the husband. \"You can easily mind the porter's lodge by yourself. I ask, citizen, is this fair? I have on every occasion done my duty\u2014in 1830, in '32, in '34, and in '39! To-day they're fighting again. I must fight! Go away!\"\n\nAnd the porter's wife ended by yielding to his remonstrances and to those of a National Guard near them\u2014a man of forty, whose simple face was adorned with a circle of white beard. He loaded his gun and fired while talking to Frederick, as cool in the midst of the outbreak as a horticulturist in his garden. A young lad with a packing-cloth thrown over him was trying to coax this man to give him a few caps, so that he might make use of a gun he had, a fine fowling-piece which a \"gentleman\" had made him a present of.\n\n\"Catch on behind my back,\" said the good man, \"and keep yourself from being seen, or you'll get yourself killed!\"\n\nThe drums beat for the charge. Sharp cries, hurrahs of triumph burst forth. A continual ebbing to and fro made the multitude sway backward and forward. Frederick, caught between two thick masses of people, did not move an inch, all the time fascinated and exceedingly amused by the scene around him. The wounded who sank to the ground, the dead lying at his feet, did not seem like persons really wounded or really dead. The impression left on his mind was that he was looking on at a show.\nIn the midst of the surging throng, above the sea of heads, could be seen an old man in a black coat, mounted on a white horse with a velvet saddle. He held in one hand a green bough, in the other a paper, and he kept shaking them persistently; but at length, giving up all hope of obtaining a hearing, he withdrew from the scene.\n\nThe soldiers of the Line had gone, and only the municipal troops remained to defend the guard-house. A wave of dauntless spirits dashed up the steps; they were flung down; others came on to replace them, and the gate resounded under blows from iron bars. The municipal guards did not give way. But a wagon, stuffed full of hay, and burning like a gigantic torch, was dragged against the walls. Faggots were speedily brought, then straw, and a barrel of spirits of wine. The fire mounted up to the stones along the wall; the building began to send forth smoke on all sides like the crater of a volcano; and at its summit, between the balustrades of the terrace, huge flames escaped with a harsh noise. The first story of the Palais-Royal was occupied by National Guards. Shots were fired through every window in the square; the bullets whizzed, the water of the fountain, which had burst, was mingled with the blood, forming little pools on the ground. People slipped in the mud over clothes, shakos, and weapons. Frederick felt something soft under his foot. It was the hand of a sergeant in a grey great-coat, lying on his face in the stream that ran along the street. Fresh bands of people were continually coming up, pushing on the combatants at the guard-house. The firing became quicker. The wine-shops were open; people went into them from time to time to smoke a pipe and drink a glass of beer, and then came back again to fight. A lost dog began to howl. This made the people laugh.\n\nFrederick was shaken by the impact of a man falling on his shoulder with a bullet through his back and the death-rattle in his throat. At this shot, perhaps directed against himself, he felt himself stirred up to rage; and he was plunging forward when a National Guard stopped him.\n\n\"'Tis useless! the King has just gone! Ah! if you don't believe me, go and see for yourself!\"\n\nThis assurance calmed Frederick. The Place du Carrousel had a tranquil aspect. The H\u00f4tel de Nantes stood there as fixed as ever; and the houses in the rear; the dome of the Louvre in front, the long gallery of wood at the right, and the waste plot of ground that ran unevenly as far as the sheds of the stall-keepers were, so to speak, steeped in the grey hues of the atmosphere, where indistinct murmurs seemed to mingle with the fog; while, at the opposite side of the square, a stiff light, falling through the parting of the clouds on the fa\u00e7ade of the Tuileries, cut out all its windows into white patches. Near the Arc de Triomphe a dead horse lay on the ground. Behind the gratings groups consisting of five or six persons were chatting. The doors leading into the ch\u00e2teau were open, and the servants at the thresholds allowed the people to enter.\n\nBelow stairs, in a kind of little parlour, bowls of caf\u00e9 au lait were handed round. A few of those present sat down to the table and made merry; others remained standing, and amongst the latter was a hackney-coachman. He snatched up with both hands a glass vessel full of powdered sugar, cast a restless glance right and left, and then began to eat voraciously, with his nose stuck into the mouth of the vessel.\n\nAt the bottom of the great staircase a man was writing his name in a register.\n\nFrederick was able to recognise him by his back.\n\n\"Hallo, Hussonnet!\"\n\n\"Yes, 'tis I,\" replied the Bohemian. \"I am introducing myself at court. This is a nice joke, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Suppose we go upstairs?\"\n\nAnd they reached presently the Salle des Mar\u00e9chaux. The portraits of those illustrious generals, save that of Bugeaud, which had been pierced through the stomach, were all intact. They were represented leaning on their sabres with a gun-carriage behind each of them, and in formidable attitudes in contrast with the occasion. A large timepiece proclaimed it was twenty minutes past one.\n\nSuddenly the \"Marseillaise\" resounded. Hussonnet and Frederick bent over the balusters. It was the people. They rushed up the stairs, shaking with a dizzying, wave-like motion bare heads, or helmets, or red caps, or else bayonets or human shoulders with such impetuosity that some people disappeared every now and then in this swarming mass, which was mounting up without a moment's pause, like a river compressed by an equinoctial tide, with a continuous roar under an irresistible impulse. When they got to the top of the stairs, they were scattered, and their chant died away. Nothing could any longer be heard but the tramp of all the shoes intermingled with the chopping sound of many voices. The crowd not being in a mischievous mood, contented themselves with looking about them. But, from time to time, an elbow, by pressing too hard, broke through a pane of glass, or else a vase or a statue rolled from a bracket down on the floor. The wainscotings cracked under the pressure of people against them. Every face was flushed; the perspiration was rolling down their features in large beads. Hussonnet made this remark:\n\"Heroes have not a good smell.\"\n\n\"Ah! you are provoking,\" returned Frederick.\n\nAnd, pushed forward in spite of themselves, they entered an apartment in which a dais of red velvet rose as far as the ceiling. On the throne below sat a representative of the proletariat in effigy with a black beard, his shirt gaping open, a jolly air, and the stupid look of a baboon. Others climbed up the platform to sit in his place.\n\n\"What a myth!\" said Hussonnet. \"There you see the sovereign people!\"\n\nThe armchair was lifted up on the hands of a number of persons and passed across the hall, swaying from one side to the other.\n\n\"By Jove, 'tis like a boat! The Ship of State is tossing about in a stormy sea! Let it dance the cancan! Let it dance the cancan!\"\n\nThey had drawn it towards a window, and in the midst of hisses, they launched it out.\n\n\"Poor old chap!\" said Hussonnet, as he saw the effigy falling into the garden, where it was speedily picked up in order to be afterwards carried to the Bastille and burned.\n\nThen a frantic joy burst forth, as if, instead of the throne, a future of boundless happiness had appeared; and the people, less through a spirit of vindictiveness than to assert their right of possession, broke or tore the glasses, the curtains, the lustres, the tapers, the tables, the chairs, the stools, the entire furniture, including the very albums and engravings, and the corbels of the tapestry. Since they had triumphed, they must needs amuse themselves! The common herd ironically wrapped themselves up in laces and cashmeres. Gold fringes were rolled round the sleeves of blouses. Hats with ostriches' feathers adorned blacksmiths' heads, and ribbons of the Legion of Honour supplied waistbands for prostitutes. Each person satisfied his or her caprice; some danced, others drank. In the queen's apartment a woman gave a gloss to her hair with pomatum. Behind a folding-screen two lovers were playing cards. Hussonnet pointed out to Frederick an individual who was smoking a dirty pipe with his elbows resting on a balcony; and the popular frenzy redoubled with a continuous crash of broken porcelain and pieces of crystal, which, as they rebounded, made sounds resembling those produced by the plates of musical glasses.\n\nThen their fury was overshadowed. A nauseous curiosity made them rummage all the dressing-rooms, all the recesses. Returned convicts thrust their arms into the beds in which princesses had slept, and rolled themselves on the top of them, to console themselves for not being able to embrace their owners. Others, with sinister faces, roamed about silently, looking for something to steal, but too great a multitude was there. Through the bays of the doors could be seen in the suite of apartments only the dark mass of people between the gilding of the walls under a cloud of dust. Every breast was panting. The heat became more and more suffocating; and the two friends, afraid of being stifled, seized the opportunity of making their way out.\n\nIn the antechamber, standing on a heap of garments, appeared a girl of the town as a statue of Liberty, motionless, her grey eyes wide open\u2014a fearful sight.\n\nThey had taken three steps outside the ch\u00e2teau when a company of the National Guards, in great-coats, advanced towards them, and, taking off their foraging-caps, and, at the same time, uncovering their skulls, which were slightly bald, bowed very low to the people. At this testimony of respect, the ragged victors bridled up. Hussonnet and Frederick were not without experiencing a certain pleasure from it as well as the rest.\n\nThey were filled with ardour. They went back to the Palais-Royal. In front of the Rue Fromanteau, soldiers' corpses were heaped up on the straw. They passed close to the dead without a single quiver of emotion, feeling a certain pride in being able to keep their countenance.\nThe Palais overflowed with people. In the inner courtyard seven piles of wood were flaming. Pianos, chests of drawers, and clocks were hurled out through the windows. Fire-engines sent streams of water up to the roofs. Some vagabonds tried to cut the hose with their sabres. Frederick urged a pupil of the Polytechnic School to interfere. The latter did not understand him, and, moreover, appeared to be an idiot. All around, in the two galleries, the populace, having got possession of the cellars, gave themselves up to a horrible carouse. Wine flowed in streams and wetted people's feet; the mudlarks drank out of the tail-ends of the bottles, and shouted as they staggered along.\n\n\"Come away out of this,\" said Hussonnet; \"I am disgusted with the people.\"\n\nAll over the Orl\u00e9ans Gallery the wounded lay on mattresses on the ground, with purple curtains folded round them as coverlets; and the small shopkeepers' wives and daughters from the quarter brought them broth and linen.\n\n\"No matter!\" said Frederick; \"for my part, I consider the people sublime.\"\n\nThe great vestibule was filled with a whirlwind of furious individuals. Men tried to ascend to the upper storys in order to put the finishing touches to the work of wholesale destruction. National Guards, on the steps, strove to keep them back. The most intrepid was a chasseur, who had his head bare, his hair bristling, and his straps in pieces. His shirt caused a swelling between his trousers and his coat, and he struggled desperately in the midst of the others. Hussonnet, who had sharp sight, recognised Arnoux from a distance.\n\nThen they went into the Tuileries garden, so as to be able to breathe more freely. They sat down on a bench; and they remained for some minutes with their eyes closed, so much stunned that they had not the energy to say a word. The people who were passing came up to them and informed them that the Duchesse d'Orl\u00e9ans had been appointed Regent, and that it was all over. They were experiencing that species of comfort which follows rapid d\u00e9nouements, when at the windows of the attics in the ch\u00e2teau appeared men-servants tearing their liveries to pieces. They flung their torn clothes into the garden, as a mark of renunciation. The people hooted at them, and then they retired.\n\nThe attention of Frederick and Hussonnet was distracted by a tall fellow who was walking quickly between the trees with a musket on his shoulder. A cartridge-box was pressed against his pea-jacket; a handkerchief was wound round his forehead under his cap. He turned his head to one side. It was Dussardier; and casting himself into their arms:\n\n\"Ah! what good fortune, my poor old friends!\" without being able to say another word, so much out of breath was he with fatigue.\n\nHe had been on his legs for the last twenty-four hours. He had been engaged at the barricades of the Latin Quarter, had fought in the Rue Rabuteau, had saved three dragoons' lives, had entered the Tuileries with Colonel Dunoyer, and, after that, had repaired to the Chamber, and then to the H\u00f4tel de Ville.\n\n\"I have come from it! all goes well! the people are victorious! the workmen and the employers are embracing one another. Ha! if you knew what I have seen! what brave fellows! what a fine sight it was!\"\n\nAnd without noticing that they had no arms:\n\n\"I was quite certain of finding you there! This has been a bit rough\u2014no matter!\"\n\nA drop of blood ran down his cheek, and in answer to the questions put to him by the two others:\n\n\"Oh! 'tis nothing! a slight scratch from a bayonet!\"\n\n\"However, you really ought to take care of yourself.\"\n\n\"Pooh! I am substantial! What does this signify? The Republic is proclaimed! We'll be happy henceforth! Some journalists, who were talking just now in front of me, said they were going to liberate Poland and Italy! No more kings! You understand? The entire land free! the entire land free!\"\n\nAnd with one comprehensive glance at the horizon, he spread out his arms in a triumphant attitude. But a long file of men rushed over the terrace on the water's edge.\n\n\"Ah, deuce take it! I was forgetting. I must be off. Good-bye!\"\n\nHe turned round to cry out to them while brandishing his musket:\n\n\"Long live the Republic!\"\n\nFrom the chimneys of the ch\u00e2teau escaped enormous whirlwinds of black smoke which bore sparks along with them. The ringing of the bells sent out over the city a wild and startling alarm. Right and left, in every direction, the conquerors discharged their weapons.\n\nFrederick, though he was not a warrior, felt the Gallic blood leaping in his veins. The magnetism of the public enthusiasm had seized hold of him. He inhaled with a voluptuous delight the stormy atmosphere filled with the odour of gunpowder; and, in the meantime, he quivered under the effluvium of an immense love, a supreme and universal tenderness, as if the heart of all humanity were throbbing in his breast.\n\nHussonnet said with a yawn:\n\n\"It would be time, perhaps, to go and instruct the populace.\"\n\nFrederick followed him to his correspondence-office in the Place de la Bourse; and he began to compose for the Troyes newspaper an account of recent events in a lyric style\u2014a veritable tit-bit\u2014to which he attached his signature. Then they dined together at a tavern. Hussonnet was pensive; the eccentricities of the Revolution exceeded his own.\n\nAfter leaving the caf\u00e9, when they repaired to the H\u00f4tel de Ville to learn the news, the boyish impulses which were natural to him had got the upper hand once more. He scaled the barricades like a chamois, and answered the sentinels with broad jokes of a patriotic flavour.\n\nThey heard the Provisional Government proclaimed by torchlight. At last, Frederick got back to his house at midnight, overcome with fatigue.\n\n\"Well,\" said he to his man-servant, while the latter was undressing him, \"are you satisfied?\"\n\n\"Yes, no doubt, Monsieur; but I don't like to see the people dancing to music.\"\n\nNext morning, when he awoke, Frederick thought of Deslauriers. He hastened to his friend's lodgings. He ascertained that the advocate had just left Paris, having been appointed a provincial commissioner. At the soir\u00e9e given the night before, he had got into contact with Ledru-Rollin, and laying siege to him in the name of the Law Schools, had snatched from him a post, a mission. However, the doorkeeper explained, he was going to write and give his address in the following week.\n\nAfter this, Frederick went to see the Mar\u00e9chale. She gave him a chilling reception. She resented his desertion of her. Her bitterness disappeared when he had given her repeated assurances that peace was restored.\n\nAll was quiet now. There was no reason to be afraid. He kissed her, and she declared herself in favour of the Republic, as his lordship the Archbishop of Paris had already done, and as the magistracy, the Council of State, the Institute, the marshals of France, Changarnier, M. de Falloux, all the Bonapartists, all the Legitimists, and a considerable number of Orl\u00e9anists were about to do with a swiftness indicative of marvellous zeal.\n\nThe fall of the Monarchy had been so rapid that, as soon as the first stupefaction that succeeded it had passed away, there was amongst the middle class a feeling of astonishment at the fact that they were still alive. The summary execution of some thieves, who were shot without a trial, was regarded as an act of signal justice. For a month Lamartine's phrase was repeated with reference to the red flag, \"which had only gone the round of the Champ de Mars, while the tricoloured flag,\" etc.; and all ranged themselves under its shade, each party seeing amongst the three colours only its own, and firmly determined, as soon as it would be the most powerful, to tear away the two others.\n\nAs business was suspended, anxiety and love of gaping drove everyone into the open air. The careless style of costume generally adopted attenuated differences of social position. Hatred masked itself; expectations were openly indulged in; the multitude seemed full of good-nature. The pride of having gained their rights shone in the people's faces. They displayed the gaiety of a carnival, the manners of a bivouac. Nothing could be more amusing than the aspect of Paris during the first days that followed the Revolution.\n\nFrederick gave the Mar\u00e9chale his arm, and they strolled along through the streets together. She was highly diverted by the display of rosettes in every buttonhole, by the banners hung from every window, and the bills of every colour that were posted upon the walls, and threw some money here and there into the collection-boxes for the wounded, which were placed on chairs in the middle of the pathway. Then she stopped before some caricatures representing Louis Philippe as a pastry-cook, as a mountebank, as a dog, or as a leech. But she was a little frightened at the sight of Caussidi\u00e8re's men with their sabres and scarfs. At other times it was a tree of Liberty that was being planted. The clergy vied with each other in blessing the Republic, escorted by servants in gold lace; and the populace thought this very fine. The most frequent spectacle was that of deputations from no matter what, going to demand something at the H\u00f4tel de Ville, for every trade, every industry, was looking to the Government to put a complete end to its wretchedness. Some of them, it is true, went to offer it advice or to congratulate it, or merely to pay it a little visit, and to see the machine performing its functions. One day, about the middle of the month of March, as they were passing the Pont d'Arcole, having to do some commission for Rosanette in the Latin Quarter, Frederick saw approaching a column of individuals with oddly-shaped hats and long beards. At its head, beating a drum, walked a negro who had formerly been an artist's model; and the man who bore the banner, on which this inscription floated in the wind, \"Artist-Painters,\" was no other than Pellerin.\n\nHe made a sign to Frederick to wait for him, and then reappeared five minutes afterwards, having some time before him; for the Government was, at that moment, receiving a deputation from the stone-cutters. He was going with his colleagues to ask for the creation of a Forum of Art, a kind of Exchange where the interests of \u00c6sthetics would be discussed. Sublime masterpieces would be produced, inasmuch as the workers would amalgamate their talents. Ere long Paris would be covered with gigantic monuments. He would decorate them. He had even begun a figure of the Republic. One of his comrades had come to take it, for they were closely pursued by the deputation from the poulterers.\n\n\"What stupidity!\" growled a voice in the crowd. \"Always some humbug, nothing strong!\"\n\nIt was Regimbart. He did not salute Frederick, but took advantage of the occasion to give vent to his own bitterness.\n\nThe Citizen spent his days wandering about the streets, pulling his moustache, rolling his eyes about, accepting and propagating any dismal news that was communicated to him; and he had only two phrases: \"Take care! we're going to be run over!\" or else, \"Why, confound it! they're juggling with the Republic!\" He was discontented with everything, and especially with the fact that we had not taken back our natural frontiers.\n\nThe very name of Lamartine made him shrug his shoulders. He did not consider Ledru-Rollin \"sufficient for the problem,\" referred to Dupont (of the Eure) as an old numbskull, Albert as an idiot, Louis Blanc as an Utopist, and Blanqui as an exceedingly dangerous man; and when Frederick asked him what would be the best thing to do, he replied, pressing his arm till he nearly bruised it:\n\n\"To take the Rhine, I tell you! to take the Rhine, damn it!\"\n\nThen he blamed the Reactionaries. They were taking off the mask. The sack of the ch\u00e2teau of Neuilly and Suresne, the fire at Batignolles, the troubles at Lyons, all the excesses and all the grievances, were just now being exaggerated by having superadded to them Ledru-Rollin's circular, the forced currency of bank-notes, the fall of the funds to sixty francs, and, to crown all, as the supreme iniquity, a final blow, a culminating horror, the duty of forty-five centimes! And over and above all these things, there was again Socialism! Although these theories, as new as the game of goose, had been discussed sufficiently for forty years to fill a number of libraries, they terrified the wealthier citizens, as if they had been a hailstorm of a\u00ebrolites; and they expressed indignation at them by virtue of that hatred which the advent of every idea provokes, simply because it is an idea\u2014an odium from which it derives subsequently its glory, and which causes its enemies to be always beneath it, however lowly it may be.\n\nThen Property rose in their regard to the level of Religion, and was confounded with God. The attacks made on it appeared to them a sacrilege; almost a species of cannibalism. In spite of the most humane legislation that ever existed, the spectre of '93 reappeared, and the chopper of the guillotine vibrated in every syllable of the word \"Republic,\" which did not prevent them from despising it for its weakness. France, no longer feeling herself mistress of the situation, was beginning to shriek with terror, like a blind man without his stick or an infant that had lost its nurse.\n\nOf all Frenchmen, M. Dambreuse was the most alarmed. The new condition of things threatened his fortune, but, more than anything else, it deceived his experience. A system so good! a king so wise! was it possible? The ground was giving way beneath their feet! Next morning he dismissed three of his servants, sold his horses, bought a soft hat to go out into the streets, thought even of letting his beard grow; and he remained at home, prostrated, reading over and over again newspapers most hostile to his own ideas, and plunged into such a gloomy mood that even the jokes about the pipe of Flocon[F] had not the power to make him smile.\n\nAs a supporter of the last reign, he was dreading the vengeance of the people so far as concerned his estates in Champagne when Frederick's lucubration fell into his hands. Then it occurred to his mind that his young friend was a very useful personage, and that he might be able, if not to serve him, at least to protect him, so that, one morning, M. Dambreuse presented himself at Frederick's residence, accompanied by Martinon.\n\nThis visit, he said, had no object save that of seeing him for a little while, and having a chat with him. In short, he rejoiced at the events that had happened, and with his whole heart adopted \"our sublime motto, Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity,\" having always been at bottom a Republican. If he voted under the other r\u00e9gime with the Ministry, it was simply in order to accelerate an inevitable downfall. He even inveighed against M. Guizot, \"who has got us into a nice hobble, we must admit!\" By way of retaliation, he spoke in an enthusiastic fashion about Lamartine, who had shown himself \"magnificent, upon my word of honour, when, with reference to the red flag\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\"Yes, I know,\" said Frederick. After which he declared that his sympathies were on the side of the working-men.\n\n\"For, in fact, more or less, we are all working-men!\" And he carried his impartiality so far as to acknowledge that Proudhon had a certain amount of logic in his views. \"Oh, a great deal of logic, deuce take it!\"\n\nThen, with the disinterestedness of a superior mind, he chatted about the exhibition of pictures, at which he had seen Pellerin's work. He considered it original and well-painted.\n\nMartinon backed up all he said with expressions of approval; and likewise was of his opinion that it was necessary to rally boldly to the side of the Republic. And he talked about the husbandman, his father, and assumed the part of the peasant, the man of the people. They soon came to the question of the elections for the National Assembly, and the candidates in the arrondissement of La Fortelle. The Opposition candidate had no chance.\n\n\"You should take his place!\" said M. Dambreuse.\n\nFrederick protested.\n\n\"But why not?\" For he would obtain the suffrages of the Extremists owing to his personal opinions, and that of the Conservatives on account of his family; \"And perhaps also,\" added the banker, with a smile, \"thanks to my influence, in some measure.\"\n\nFrederick urged as an obstacle that he did not know how to set about it.\n\nThere was nothing easier if he only got himself recommended to the patriots of the Aube by one of the clubs of the capital. All he had to do was to read out, not a profession of faith such as might be seen every day, but a serious statement of principles.\n\n\"Bring it to me; I know what goes down in the locality; and you can, I say again, render great services to the country\u2014to us all\u2014to myself.\"\n\nIn such times people ought to aid each other, and, if Frederick had need of anything, he or his friends\u2014\u2014\n\n\"Oh, a thousand thanks, my dear Monsieur!\"\n\n\"You'll do as much for me in return, mind!\"\n\nDecidedly, the banker was a decent man.\n\nFrederick could not refrain from pondering over his advice; and soon he was dazzled by a kind of dizziness.\n\nThe great figures of the Convention passed before his mental vision. It seemed to him that a splendid dawn was about to rise. Rome, Vienna and Berlin were in a state of insurrection, and the Austrians had been driven out of Venice. All Europe was agitated. Now was the time to make a plunge into the movement, and perhaps to accelerate it; and then he was fascinated by the costume which it was said the deputies would wear. Already he saw himself in a waistcoat with lapels and a tricoloured sash; and this itching, this hallucination, became so violent that he opened his mind to Dambreuse.\n\nThe honest fellow's enthusiasm had not abated.\n\n\"Certainly\u2014sure enough! Offer yourself!\"\n\nFrederick, nevertheless, consulted Deslauriers.\n\nThe idiotic opposition which trammelled the commissioner in his province had augmented his Liberalism. He at once replied, exhorting Frederick with the utmost vehemence to come forward as a candidate. However, as the latter was desirous of having the approval of a great number of persons, he confided the thing to Rosanette one day, when Mademoiselle Vatnaz happened to be present.\n\nShe was one of those Parisian spinsters who, every evening when they have given their lessons or tried to sell little sketches, or to dispose of poor manuscripts, return to their own homes with mud on their petticoats, make their own dinner, which they eat by themselves, and then, with their soles resting on a foot-warmer, by the light of a filthy lamp, dream of a love, a family, a hearth, wealth\u2014all that they lack. So it was that, like many others, she had hailed in the Revolution the advent of vengeance, and she delivered herself up to a Socialistic propaganda of the most unbridled description.\n\nThe enfranchisement of the proletariat, according to the Vatnaz, was only possible by the enfranchisement of woman. She wished to have her own sex admitted to every kind of employment, to have an enquiry made into the paternity of children, a different code, the abolition, or at least a more intelligent regulation, of marriage. In that case every Frenchwoman would be bound to marry a Frenchman, or to adopt an old man. Nurses and midwives should be officials receiving salaries from the State.\n\nThere should be a jury to examine the works of women, special editors for women, a polytechnic school for women, a National Guard for women, everything for women! And, since the Government ignored their rights, they ought to overcome force by force. Ten thousand citizenesses with good guns ought to make the H\u00f4tel de Ville quake!\n\nFrederick's candidature appeared to her favourable for carrying out her ideas. She encouraged him, pointing out the glory that shone on the horizon. Rosanette was delighted at the notion of having a man who would make speeches at the Chamber.\n\n\"And then, perhaps, they'll give you a good place?\"\n\nFrederick, a man prone to every kind of weakness, was infected by the universal mania. He wrote an address and went to show it to M. Dambreuse.\n\nAt the sound made by the great door falling back, a curtain gaped open a little behind a casement, and a woman appeared at it He had not time to find out who she was; but, in the anteroom, a picture arrested his attention\u2014Pellerin's picture\u2014which lay on a chair, no doubt provisionally.\n\nIt represented the Republic, or Progress, or Civilisation, under the form of Jesus Christ driving a locomotive, which was passing through a virgin forest. Frederick, after a minute's contemplation, exclaimed:\n\n\"What a vile thing!\"\n\n\"Is it not\u2014eh?\" said M. Dambreuse, coming in unexpectedly just at the moment when the other was giving utterance to this opinion, and fancying that it had reference, not so much to the picture as to the doctrine glorified by the work. Martinon presented himself at the same time. They made their way into the study, and Frederick was drawing a paper out of his pocket, when Mademoiselle C\u00e9cile, entering suddenly, said, articulating her words in an ingenuous fashion:\n\n\"Is my aunt here?\"\n\n\"You know well she is not,\" replied the banker. \"No matter! act as if you were at home, Mademoiselle.\"\n\n\"Oh! thanks! I am going away!\"\n\nScarcely had she left when Martinon seemed to be searching for his handkerchief.\n\n\"I forgot to take it out of my great-coat\u2014excuse me!\"\n\n\"All right!\" said M. Dambreuse.\n\nEvidently he was not deceived by this man\u0153uvre, and even seemed to regard it with favour. Why? But Martinon soon reappeared, and Frederick began reading his address.\n\nAt the second page, which pointed towards the preponderance of the financial interests as a disgraceful fact, the banker made a grimace. Then, touching on reforms, Frederick demanded free trade.\n\n\"What? Allow me, now!\"\n\nThe other paid no attention, and went on. He called for a tax on yearly incomes, a progressive tax, a European federation, and the education of the people, the encouragement of the fine arts on the liberal scale.\n\n\"When the country could provide men like Delacroix or Hugo with incomes of a hundred thousand francs, where would be the harm?\"\n\nAt the close of the address advice was given to the upper classes.\n\n\"Spare nothing, ye rich; but give! give!\"\n\nHe stopped, and remained standing. The two who had been listening to him did not utter a word. Martinon opened his eyes wide; M. Dambreuse was quite pale. At last, concealing his emotion under a bitter smile:\n\n\"That address of yours is simply perfect!\" And he praised the style exceedingly in order to avoid giving his opinion as to the matter of the address.\n\nThis virulence on the part of an inoffensive young man frightened him, especially as a sign of the times.\n\nMartinon tried to reassure him. The Conservative party, in a little while, would certainly be able to take its revenge. In several cities the commissioners of the provisional government had been driven away; the elections were not to occur till the twenty-third of April; there was plenty of time. In short, it was necessary for M. Dambreuse to present himself personally in the Aube; and from that time forth, Martinon no longer left his side, became his secretary, and was as attentive to him as any son could be.\n\nFrederick arrived at Rosanette's house in a very self-complacent mood. Delmar happened to be there, and told him of his intention to stand as a candidate at the Seine elections. In a placard addressed to the people, in which he addressed them in the familiar manner which one adopts towards an individual, the actor boasted of being able to understand them, and of having, in order to save them, got himself \"crucified for the sake of art,\" so that he was the incarnation, the ideal of the popular spirit, believing that he had, in fact, such enormous power over the masses that he proposed by-and-by, when he occupied a ministerial office, to quell any outbreak by himself alone; and, with regard to the means he would employ, he gave this answer: \"Never fear! I'll show them my head!\"\n\nFrederick, in order to mortify him, gave him to understand that he was himself a candidate. The mummer, from the moment that his future colleague aspired to represent the province, declared himself his servant, and offered to be his guide to the various clubs.\n\nThey visited them, or nearly all, the red and the blue, the furious and the tranquil, the puritanical and the licentious, the mystical and the intemperate, those that had voted for the death of kings, and those in which the frauds in the grocery trade had been denounced; and everywhere the tenants cursed the landlords; the blouse was full of spite against broadcloth; and the rich conspired against the poor. Many wanted indemnities on the ground that they had formerly been martyrs of the police; others appealed for money in order to carry out certain inventions, or else there were plans of phalansteria, projects for cantonal bazaars, systems of public felicity; then, here and there a flash of genius amid these clouds of folly, sudden as splashes, the law formulated by an oath, and flowers of eloquence on the lips of some soldier-boy, with a shoulder-belt strapped over his bare, shirtless chest. Sometimes, too, a gentleman made his appearance\u2014an aristocrat of humble demeanour, talking in a plebeian strain, and with his hands unwashed, so as to make them look hard. A patriot recognised him; the most virtuous mobbed him; and he went off with rage in his soul. On the  pretext of good sense, it was desirable to be always disparaging the advocates, and to make use as often as possible of these expressions: \"To carry his stone to the building,\" \"social problem,\" \"workshop.\"\n\nDelmar did not miss the opportunities afforded him for getting in a word; and when he no longer found anything to say, his device was to plant himself in some conspicuous position with one of his arms akimbo and the other in his waistcoat, turning himself round abruptly in profile, so as to give a good view of his head. Then there were outbursts of applause, which came from Mademoiselle Vatnaz at the lower end of the hall.\n\nFrederick, in spite of the weakness of orators, did not dare to try the experiment of speaking. All those people seemed to him too unpolished or too hostile.\n\nBut Dussardier made enquiries, and informed him that there existed in the Rue Saint-Jacques a club which bore the name of the \"Club of Intellect.\" Such a name gave good reason for hope. Besides, he would bring some friends there.\n\nHe brought those whom he had invited to take punch with him\u2014the bookkeeper, the traveller in wines, and the architect; even Pellerin had offered to come, and Hussonnet would probably form one of the party, and on the footpath before the door stood Regimbart, with two individuals, the first of whom was his faithful Compain, a rather thick-set man marked with small-pox and with bloodshot eyes; and the second, an ape-like negro, exceedingly hairy, and whom he knew only in the character of \"a patriot from Barcelona.\"\n\nThey passed though a passage, and were then introduced into a large room, no doubt used by a joiner, and with walls still fresh and smelling of plaster. Four argand lamps were hanging parallel to each other, and shed an unpleasant light. On a platform, at the end of the room, there was a desk with a bell; underneath it a table, representing the rostrum, and on each side two others, somewhat lower, for the secretaries. The audience that adorned the benches consisted of old painters of daubs, ushers, and literary men who could not get their works published.\n\nIn the midst of those lines of paletots with greasy collars could be seen here and there a woman's cap or a workman's linen smock. The bottom of the apartment was even full of workmen, who had in all likelihood come there to pass away an idle hour, and who had been introduced by some speakers in order that they might applaud.\n\nFrederick took care to place himself between Dussardier and Regimbart, who was scarcely seated when he leaned both hands on his walking-stick and his chin on his hands and shut his eyes, whilst at the other end of the room Delmar stood looking down at the assembly. S\u00e9n\u00e9cal appeared at the president's desk.\n\nThe worthy bookkeeper thought Frederick would be pleased at this unexpected discovery. It only annoyed him.\n\nThe meeting exhibited great respect for the president. He was one who, on the twenty-fifth of February, had desired an immediate organisation of labour. On the following day, at the Prado, he had declared himself in favour attacking the H\u00f4tel de Ville; and, as every person at that period took some model for imitation, one copied Saint-Just, another Danton, another Marat; as for him, he tried to be like Blanqui, who imitated Robespierre. His black gloves, and his hair brushed back, gave him a rigid aspect exceedingly becoming.\n\nHe opened the proceedings with the declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen\u2014a customary act of faith. Then, a vigorous voice struck up B\u00e9ranger's \"Souvenirs du Peuple.\"\n\nOther voices were raised:\n\n\"No! no! not that!\"\n\n\"'La Casquette!'\" the patriots at the bottom of the apartment began to howl.\n\nAnd they sang in chorus the favourite lines of the period:\n\n\"Doff your hat before my cap\u2014\nKneel before the working-man!\"\nAt a word from the president the audience became silent.\n\nOne of the secretaries proceeded to inspect the letters.\n\nSome young men announced that they burned a number of the Assembl\u00e9e Nationale every evening in front of the Panth\u00e9on, and they urged on all patriots to follow their example.\n\n\"Bravo! adopted!\" responded the audience.\n\nThe Citizen Jean Jacques Langreneux, a printer in the Rue Dauphin, would like to have a monument raised to the memory of the martyrs of Thermidor.\n\nMichel Evariste N\u00e9pomuc\u00e8ne, ex-professor, gave expression to the wish that the European democracy should adopt unity of language. A dead language might be used for that purpose\u2014as, for example, improved Latin.\n\n\"No; no Latin!\" exclaimed the architect.\n\n\"Why?\" said the college-usher.\n\nAnd these two gentlemen engaged in a discussion, in which the others also took part, each putting in a word of his own for effect; and the conversation on this topic soon became so tedious that many went away. But a little old man, who wore at the top of his prodigiously high forehead a pair of green spectacles, asked permission to speak in order to make an important communication.\n\nIt was a memorandum on the assessment of taxes. The figures flowed on in a continuous stream, as if they were never going to end. The impatience of the audience found vent at first in murmurs, in whispered talk. He allowed nothing to put him out. Then they began hissing; they catcalled him. S\u00e9n\u00e9cal called the persons who were interrupting to order. The orator went on like a machine. It was necessary to catch him by the shoulder in order to stop him. The old fellow looked as if he were waking out of a dream, and, placidly lifting his spectacles, said:\n\n\"Pardon me, citizens! pardon me! I am going\u2014a thousand excuses!\"\n\nFrederick was disconcerted with the failure of the old man's attempts to read this written statement. He had his own address in his pocket, but an extemporaneous speech would have been preferable.\n\nFinally the president announced that they were about to pass on to the important matter, the electoral question. They would not discuss the big Republican lists. However, the \"Club of Intellect\" had every right, like every other, to form one, \"with all respect for the pachas of the H\u00f4tel de Ville,\" and the citizens who solicited the popular mandate might set forth their claims.\n\n\"Go on, now!\" said Dussardier.\n\nA man in a cassock, with woolly hair and a petulant expression on his face, had already raised his hand. He said, with a stutter, that his name was Ducretot, priest and agriculturist, and that he was the author of a work entitled \"Manures.\" He was told to send it to a horticultural club.\n\nThen a patriot in a blouse climbed up into the rostrum. He was a plebeian, with broad shoulders, a big face, very mild-looking, with long black hair. He cast on the assembly an almost voluptuous glance, flung back his head, and, finally, spreading out his arms:\n\n\"You have repelled Ducretot, O my brothers! and you have done right; but it was not through irreligion, for we are all religious.\"\n\nMany of those present listened open-mouthed, with the air of catechumens and in ecstatic attitudes.\n\n\"It is not either because he is a priest, for we, too, are priests! The workman is a priest, just as the founder of Socialism was\u2014the Master of us all, Jesus Christ!\"\n\nThe time had arrived to inaugurate the Kingdom of God. The Gospel led directly to '89. After the abolition of slavery, the abolition of the proletariat. They had had the age of hate\u2014the age of love was about to begin.\n\n\"Christianity is the keystone and the foundation of the new edifice\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\"You are making game of us?\" exclaimed the traveller in wines. \"Who has given me such a priest's cap?\"\n\nThis interruption gave great offence. Nearly all the audience got on benches, and, shaking their fists, shouted: \"Atheist! aristocrat! low rascal!\" whilst the president's bell kept ringing continuously, and the cries of \"Order! order!\" redoubled. But, aimless, and, moreover, fortified by three cups of coffee which he had swallowed before coming to the meeting, he struggled in the midst of the others:\n\n\"What? I an aristocrat? Come, now!\"\n\nWhen, at length, he was permitted to give an explanation, he declared that he would never be at peace with the priests; and, since something had just been said about economical measures, it would be a splendid one to put an end to the churches, the sacred pyxes, and finally all creeds.\n\nSomebody raised the objection that he was going very far.\n\n\"Yes! I am going very far! But, when a vessel is caught suddenly in a storm\u2014\u2014\"\n\nWithout waiting for the conclusion of this simile, another made a reply to his observation:\n\n\"Granted! But this is to demolish at a single stroke, like a mason devoid of judgment\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\"You are insulting the masons!\" yelled a citizen covered with plaster. And persisting in the belief that provocation had been offered to him, he vomited forth insults, and wished to fight, clinging tightly to the bench whereon he sat. It took no less than three men to put him out.\n\nMeanwhile the workman still remained on the rostrum. The two secretaries gave him an intimation that he should come down. He protested against the injustice done to him.\n\n\"You shall not prevent me from crying out, 'Eternal love to our dear France! eternal love all to the Republic!'\"\n\n\"Citizens!\" said Compain, after this\u2014\"Citizens!\"\n\nAnd, by dint of repeating \"Citizens,\" having obtained a little silence, he leaned on the rostrum with his two red hands, which looked like stumps, bent forward his body, and blinking his eyes:\n\n\"I believe that it would be necessary to give a larger extension to the calf's head.\"\n\nAll who heard him kept silent, fancying that they had misunderstood his words.\n\n\"Yes! the calf's head!\"\n\nThree hundred laughs burst forth at the same time. The ceiling shook.\n\nAt the sight of all these faces convulsed with mirth, Compain shrank back. He continued in an angry tone:\n\n\"What! you don't know what the calf's head is!\"\n\nIt was a paroxysm, a delirium. They held their sides. Some of them even tumbled off the benches to the ground with convulsions of laughter. Compain, not being able to stand it any longer, took refuge beside Regimbart, and wanted to drag him away.\n\n\"No! I am remaining till 'tis all over!\" said the Citizen.\n\nThis reply caused Frederick to make up his mind; and, as he looked about to the right and the left to see whether his friends were prepared to support him, he saw Pellerin on the rostrum in front of him.\n\nThe artist assumed a haughty tone in addressing the meeting.\n\n\"I would like to get some notion as to who is the candidate amongst all these that represents art. For my part, I have painted a picture.\"\n\n\"We have nothing to do with painting pictures!\" was the churlish remark of a thin man with red spots on his cheek-bones.\n\nPellerin protested against this interruption.\n\nBut the other, in a tragic tone:\n\n\"Ought not the Government to make an ordinance abolishing prostitution and want?\"\n\nAnd this phrase having at once won to his side the popular favour, he thundered against the corruption of great cities.\n\n\"Shame and infamy! We ought to catch hold of wealthy citizens on their way out of the Maison d'Or and spit in their faces\u2014unless it be that the Government countenances debauchery! But the collectors of the city dues exhibit towards our daughters and our sisters an amount of indecency\u2014\u2014\"\n\nA voice exclaimed, some distance away:\n\n\"This is blackguard language! Turn him out!\"\n\n\"They extract taxes from us to pay for licentiousness! Thus, the high salaries paid to actors\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\"Help!\" cried Pellerin.\n\nHe leaped from the rostrum, pushed everybody aside, and declaring that he regarded such stupid accusations with disgust, expatiated on the civilising mission of the player. Inasmuch as the theatre was the focus of national education, he would record his vote for the reform of the theatre; and to begin with, no more managements, no more privileges!\n\n\"Yes; of any sort!\"\n\nThe actor's performance excited the audience, and people moved backwards and forwards knocking each other down.\n\n\"No more academies! No more institutes!\"\n\n\"No missions!\"\n\n\"No more bachelorships! Down with University degrees!\"\n\n\"Let us preserve them,\" said S\u00e9n\u00e9cal; \"but let them be conferred by universal suffrage, by the people, the only true judge!\"\n\nBesides, these things were not the most useful. It was necessary to take a level which would be above the heads of the wealthy. And he represented them as gorging themselves with crimes under their gilded ceilings; while the poor, writhing in their garrets with famine, cultivated every virtue. The applause became so vehement that he interrupted his discourse. For several minutes he remained with his eyes closed, his head thrown back, and, as it were, lulling himself to sleep over the fury which he had aroused.\n\nThen he began to talk in a dogmatic fashion, in phrases as imperious as laws. The State should take possession of the banks and of the insurance offices. Inheritances should be abolished. A social fund should be established for the workers. Many other measures were desirable in the future. For the time being, these would suffice, and, returning to the question of the elections: \"We want pure citizens, men entirely fresh. Let some one offer himself.\"\n\nFrederick arose. There was a buzz of approval made by his friends. But S\u00e9n\u00e9cal, assuming the attitude of a Fouquier-Tinville, began to ask questions as to his Christian name and surname, his antecedents, life, and morals.\n\nFrederick answered succinctly, and bit his lips. S\u00e9n\u00e9cal asked whether anyone saw any impediment to this candidature.\n\n\"No! no!\"\n\nBut, for his part, he saw some. All around him bent forward and strained their ears to listen. The citizen who was seeking for their support had not delivered a certain sum promised by him for the foundation of a democratic journal. Moreover, on the twenty-second of February, though he had had sufficient notice on the subject, he had failed to be at the meeting-place in the Place de Panth\u00e9on.\n\n\"I swear that he was at the Tuileries!\" exclaimed Dussardier.\n\n\"Can you swear to having seen him at the Panth\u00e9on?\"\n\nDussardier hung down his head. Frederick was silent. His friends, scandalised, regarded him with disquietude.\n\n\"In any case,\" S\u00e9n\u00e9cal went on, \"do you know a patriot who will answer to us for your principles?\"\n\n\"I will!\" said Dussardier.\n\n\"Oh! this is not enough; another!\"\n\nFrederick turned round to Pellerin. The artist replied to him with a great number of gestures, which meant:\n\n\"Ah! my dear boy, they have rejected myself! The deuce! What would you have?\"\n\nThereupon Frederick gave Regimbart a nudge.\n\n\"Yes, that's true; 'tis time! I'm going.\"\n\nAnd Regimbart stepped upon the platform; then, pointing towards the Spaniard, who had followed him:\n\n\"Allow me, citizens, to present to you a patriot from Barcelona!\"\n\nThe patriot made a low bow, rolled his gleaming eyes about, and with his hand on his heart:\n\n\"Ciudadanos! mucho aprecio el honor that you have bestowed on me! however great may be vuestra bondad, mayor vuestra atenci\u00f3n!\"\n\n\"I claim the right to speak!\" cried Frederick.\n\n\"Desde que se proclamo la constituti\u00f3n de Cadiz, ese pacto fundamental of las libertades Espa\u00f1olas, hasta la ultima revoluci\u00f3n, nuestra patria cuenta numerosos y heroicos m\u00e1rtires.\"\n\nFrederick once more made an effort to obtain a hearing:\n\n\"But, citizens!\u2014--\"\n\nThe Spaniard went on: \"El martes proximo tendra lugar en la iglesia de la Magdelena un servicio f\u00fanebre.\"\n\n\"In fact, this is ridiculous! Nobody understands him!\"\n\nThis observation exasperated the audience.\n\n\"Turn him out! Turn him out!\"\n\n\"Who? I?\" asked Frederick.\n\n\"Yourself!\" said S\u00e9n\u00e9cal, majestically. \"Out with you!\"\n\nHe rose to leave, and the voice of the Iberian pursued him:\n\n\"Y todos los Espa\u00f1oles descarien ver alli reunidas las disputaci\u00f3nes de los clubs y de la milicia nacional. An oraci\u00f3n f\u00fanebre en honour of the libertad Espa\u00f1ola y del mundo entero will be prononciado por un miembro del clero of Paris en la sala Bonne Nouvelle. Honour al pueblo frances que llamaria yo el primero pueblo del mundo, sino fuese ciudadano de otra naci\u00f3n!\"\n\n\"Aristo!\" screamed one blackguard, shaking his fist at Frederick, as the latter, boiling with indignation, rushed out into the yard adjoining the place where the meeting was held.\n\nHe reproached himself for his devotedness, without reflecting that, after all, the accusations brought against him were just.\n\nWhat fatal idea was this candidature! But what asses! what idiots! He drew comparisons between himself and these men, and soothed his wounded pride with the thought of their stupidity.\n\nThen he felt the need of seeing Rosanette. After such an exhibition of ugly traits, and so much magniloquence, her dainty person would be a source of relaxation. She was aware that he had intended to present himself at a club that evening. However, she did not even ask him a single question when he came in. She was sitting near the fire, ripping open the lining of a dress. He was surprised to find her thus occupied.\n\n\"Hallo! what are you doing?\"\n\n\"You can see for yourself,\" said she, dryly. \"I am mending my clothes! So much for this Republic of yours!\"\n\n\"Why do you call it mine?\"\n\n\"Perhaps you want to make out that it's mine!\"\n\nAnd she began to upbraid him for everything that had happened in France for the last two months, accusing him of having brought about the Revolution and with having ruined her prospects by making everybody that had money leave Paris, and that she would by-and-by be dying in a hospital.\n\n\"It is easy for you to talk lightly about it, with your yearly income! However, at the rate at which things are going on, you won't have your yearly income long.\"\n\n\"That may be,\" said Frederick. \"The most devoted are always misunderstood, and if one were not sustained by one's conscience, the brutes that you mix yourself up with would make you feel disgusted with your own self-denial!\"\n\nRosanette gazed at him with knitted brows.\n\n\"Eh? What? What self-denial? Monsieur has not succeeded, it would seem? So much the better! It will teach you to make patriotic donations. Oh, don't lie! I know you have given them three hundred francs, for this Republic of yours has to be kept. Well, amuse yourself with it, my good man!\"\n\nUnder this avalanche of abuse, Frederick passed from his former disappointment to a more painful disillusion.\n\nHe withdrew to the lower end of the apartment. She came up to him.\n\n\"Look here! Think it out a bit! In a country as in a house, there must be a master, otherwise, everyone pockets something out of the money spent. At first, everybody knows that Ledru-Rollin is head over ears in debt. As for Lamartine, how can you expect a poet to understand politics? Ah! 'tis all very well for you to shake your head and to presume that you have more brains than others; all the same, what I say is true! But you are always cavilling; a person can't get in a word with you! For instance, there's Fournier-Fontaine, who had stores at Saint-Roch! do you know how much he failed for? Eight hundred thousand francs! And Gomer, the packer opposite to him\u2014another Republican, that one\u2014he smashed the tongs on his wife's head, and he drank so much absinthe that he is going to be put into a private asylum. That's the way with the whole of them\u2014the Republicans! A Republic at twenty-five percent. Ah! yes! plume yourself upon it!\"\n\nFrederick took himself off. He was disgusted at the foolishness of this girl, which revealed itself all at once in the language of the populace. He felt himself even becoming a little patriotic once more.\n\nThe ill-temper of Rosanette only increased. Mademoiselle Vatnaz irritated him with her enthusiasm. Believing that she had a mission, she felt a furious desire to make speeches, to carry on disputes, and\u2014sharper than Rosanette in matters of this sort\u2014overwhelmed her with arguments.\n\nOne day she made her appearance burning with indignation against Hussonnet, who had just indulged in some blackguard remarks at the Woman's Club. Rosanette approved of this conduct, declaring even that she would take men's clothes to go and \"give them a bit of her mind, the entire lot of them, and to whip them.\"\n\nFrederick entered at the same moment.\n\n\"You'll accompany me\u2014won't you?\"\n\nAnd, in spite of his presence, a bickering match took place between them, one of them playing the part of a citizen's wife and the other of a female philosopher.\n\nAccording to Rosanette, women were born exclusively for love, or in order to bring up children, to be housekeepers.\n\nAccording to Mademoiselle Vatnaz, women ought to have a position in the Government. In former times, the Gaulish women, and also the Anglo-Saxon women, took part in the legislation; the squaws of the Hurons formed a portion of the Council. The work of civilisation was common to both. It was necessary that all should contribute towards it, and that fraternity should be substituted for egoism, association for individualism, and cultivation on a large scale for minute subdivision of land.\n\n\"Come, that is good! you know a great deal about culture just now!\"\n\n\"Why not? Besides, it is a question of humanity, of its future!\"\n\n\"Mind your own business!\"\n\n\"This is my business!\"\n\nThey got into a passion. Frederick interposed. The Vatnaz became very heated, and went so far as to uphold Communism.\n\n\"What nonsense!\" said Rosanette. \"How could such a thing ever come to pass?\"\n\nThe other brought forward in support of her theory the examples of the Essenes, the Moravian Brethren, the Jesuits of Paraguay, the family of the Pingons near Thiers in Auvergne; and, as she gesticulated a great deal, her gold chain got entangled in her bundle of trinkets, to which was attached a gold ornament in the form of a sheep.\n\nSuddenly, Rosanette turned exceedingly pale.\n\nMademoiselle Vatnaz continued extricating her trinkets.\n\n\"Don't give yourself so much trouble,\" said Rosanette. \"Now, I know your political opinions.\"\n\n\"What?\" replied the Vatnaz, with a blush on her face like that of a virgin.\n\n\"Oh! oh! you understand me.\"\n\nFrederick did not understand. There had evidently been something taking place between them of a more important and intimate character than Socialism.\n\n\"And even though it should be so,\" said the Vatnaz in reply, rising up unflinchingly. \"'Tis a loan, my dear\u2014set off one debt against the other.\"\n\n\"Faith, I don't deny my own debts. I owe some thousands of francs\u2014a nice sum. I borrow, at least; I don't rob anyone.\"\n\nMademoiselle Vatnaz made an effort to laugh.\n\n\"Oh! I would put my hand in the fire for him.\"\n\n\"Take care! it is dry enough to burn.\"\n\nThe spinster held out her right hand to her, and keeping it raised in front of her:\n\n\"But there are friends of yours who find it convenient for them.\"\n\n\"Andalusians, I suppose? as castanets?\"\n\n\"You beggar!\"\n\nThe Mar\u00e9chale made her a low bow.\n\n\"There's nobody so charming!\"\n\nMademoiselle Vatnaz made no reply. Beads of perspiration appeared on her temples. Her eyes fixed themselves on the carpet. She panted for breath. At last she reached the door, and slamming it vigorously: \"Good night! You'll hear from me!\"\n\n\"Much I care!\" said Rosanette. The effort of self-suppression had shattered her nerves. She sank down on the divan, shaking all over, stammering forth words of abuse, shedding tears. Was it this threat on the part of the Vatnaz that had caused so much agitation in her mind? Oh, no! what did she care, indeed, about that one? It was the golden sheep, a present, and in the midst of her tears the name of Delmar escaped her lips. So, then, she was in love with the mummer?\n\n\"In that case, why did she take on with me?\" Frederick asked himself. \"How is it that he has come back again? Who compels her to keep me? Where is the sense of this sort of thing?\"\n\nRosanette was still sobbing. She remained all the time stretched at the edge of the divan, with her right cheek resting on her two hands, and she seemed a being so dainty, so free from self-consciousness, and so sorely troubled, that he drew closer to her and softly kissed her on the forehead.\n\nThereupon she gave him assurances of her affection for him; the Prince had just left her, they would be free. But she was for the time being short of money. \"You saw yourself that this was so, the other day, when I was trying to turn my old linings to use.\" No more equipages now! And this was not all; the upholsterer was threatening to resume possession of the bedroom and the large drawing-room furniture. She did not know what to do.\n\nFrederick had a mind to answer:\n\n\"Don't annoy yourself about it. I will pay.\"\n\nBut the lady knew how to lie. Experience had enlightened her. He confined himself to mere expressions of sympathy.\n\nRosanette's fears were not vain. It was necessary to give up the furniture and to quit the handsome apartment in the Rue Drouot. She took another on the Boulevard Poissonni\u00e8re, on the fourth floor.\n\nThe curiosities of her old boudoir were quite sufficient to give to the three rooms a coquettish air. There were Chinese blinds, a tent on the terrace, and in the drawing-room a second-hand carpet still perfectly new, with ottomans covered with pink silk. Frederick had contributed largely to these purchases. He had felt the joy of a newly-married man who possesses at last a house of his own, a wife of his own\u2014and, being much pleased with the place, he used to sleep there nearly every evening.\n\nOne morning, as he was passing out through the anteroom, he saw, on the third floor, on the staircase, the shako of a National Guard who was ascending it. Where in the world was he going?\n\nFrederick waited. The man continued his progress up the stairs, with his head slightly bent down. He raised his eyes. It was my lord Arnoux!\n\nThe situation was clear. They both reddened simultaneously, overcome by a feeling of embarrassment common to both.\n\nArnoux was the first to find a way out of the difficulty.\n\n\"She is better\u2014isn't that so?\" as if Rosanette were ill, and he had come to learn how she was.\n\nFrederick took advantage of this opening.\n\n\"Yes, certainly! at least, so I was told by her maid,\" wishing to convey that he had not been allowed to see her.\n\nThen they stood facing each other, both undecided as to what they would do next, and eyeing one another intently. The question now was, which of the two was going to remain. Arnoux once more solved the problem.\n\n\"Pshaw! I'll come back by-and-by. Where are you going? I go with you!\"\n\nAnd, when they were in the street, he chatted as naturally as usual. Unquestionably he was not a man of jealous disposition, or else he was too good-natured to get angry. Besides, his time was devoted to serving his country. He never left off his uniform now. On the twenty-ninth of March he had defended the offices of the Presse. When the Chamber was invaded, he distinguished himself by his courage, and he was at the banquet given to the National Guard at Amiens.\n\nHussonnet, who was still on duty with him, availed himself of his flask and his cigars; but, irreverent by nature, he delighted in contradicting him, disparaging the somewhat inaccurate style of the decrees; and decrying the conferences at the Luxembourg, the women known as the \"V\u00e9suviennes,\" the political section bearing the name of \"Tyroliens\"; everything, in fact, down to the Car of Agriculture, drawn by horses to the ox-market, and escorted by ill-favoured young girls. Arnoux, on the other hand, was the upholder of authority, and dreamed of uniting the different parties. However, his own affairs had taken an unfavourable turn, and he was more or less anxious about them.\n\nHe was not much troubled about Frederick's relations with the Mar\u00e9chale; for this discovery made him feel justified (in his conscience) in withdrawing the allowance which he had renewed since the Prince had left her. He pleaded by way of excuse for this step the embarrassed condition in which he found himself, uttered many lamentations\u2014and Rosanette was generous. The result was that M. Arnoux regarded himself as the lover who appealed entirely to the heart, an idea that raised him in his own estimation and made him feel young again. Having no doubt that Frederick was paying the Mar\u00e9chale, he fancied that he was \"playing a nice trick\" on the young man, even called at the house in such a stealthy fashion as to keep the other in ignorance of the fact, and when they happened to meet, left the coast clear for him.\n\nFrederick was not pleased with this partnership, and his rival's politeness seemed only an elaborate piece of sarcasm. But by taking offence at it, he would have removed from his path every opportunity of ever finding his way back to Madame Arnoux; and then, this was the only means whereby he could hear about her movements. The earthenware-dealer, in accordance with his usual practice, or perhaps with some cunning design, recalled her readily in the course of conversation, and asked him why he no longer came to see her.\n\nFrederick, having exhausted every excuse he could frame, assured him that he had called several times to see Madame Arnoux, but without success. Arnoux was convinced that this was so, for he had often referred in an eager tone at home to the absence of their friend, and she had invariably replied that she was out when he called, so that these two lies, in place of contradicting, corroborated each other.\n\nThe young man's gentle ways and the pleasure of finding a dupe in him made Arnoux like him all the better. He carried familiarity to its extreme limits, not through disdain, but through assurance. One day he wrote saying that very urgent business compelled him to be away in the country for twenty-four hours. He begged of the young man to mount guard in his stead. Frederick dared not refuse, so he repaired to the guard-house in the Place du Carrousel.\n\nHe had to submit to the society of the National Guards, and, with the exception of a sugar-refiner, a witty fellow who drank to an inordinate extent, they all appeared to him more stupid than their cartridge-boxes. The principal subject of conversation amongst them was the substitution of sashes for belts. Others declaimed against the national workshops.\n\nOne man said:\n\n\"Where are we going?\"\n\nThe man to whom the words had been addressed opened his eyes as if he were standing on the verge of an abyss.\n\n\"Where are we going?\"\n\nThen, one who was more daring than the rest exclaimed:\n\n\"It cannot last! It must come to an end!\"\n\nAnd as the same kind of talk went on till night, Frederick was bored to death.\n\nGreat was his surprise when, at eleven o'clock, he suddenly beheld Arnoux, who immediately explained that he had hurried back to set him at liberty, having disposed of his own business.\n\nThe fact was that he had no business to transact. The whole thing was an invention to enable him to spend twenty-four hours alone with Rosanette. But the worthy Arnoux had placed too much confidence in his own powers, so that, now in the state of lassitude which was the result, he was seized with remorse. He had come to thank Frederick, and to invite him to have some supper.\n\n\"A thousand thanks! I'm not hungry. All I want is to go to bed.\"\n\n\"A reason the more for having a snack together. How flabby you are! One does not go home at such an hour as this. It is too late! It would be dangerous!\"\n\nFrederick once more yielded. Arnoux was quite a favorite with his brethren-in-arms, who had not expected to see him\u2014and he was a particular crony of the refiner. They were all fond of him, and he was such a good fellow that he was sorry Hussonnet was not there. But he wanted to shut his eyes for one minute, no longer.\n\n\"Sit down beside me!\" said he to Frederick, stretching himself on the camp-bed without taking off his belt and straps. Through fear of an alarm, in spite of the regulation, he even kept his gun in his hand, then stammered out some words:\n\n\"My darling! my little angel!\" and ere long was fast asleep.\n\nThose who had been talking to each other became silent; and gradually there was a deep silence in the guard-house. Frederick tormented by the fleas, kept staring about him. The wall, painted yellow, had, half-way up, a long shelf, on which the knapsacks formed a succession of little humps, while underneath, the muskets, which had the colour of lead, rose up side by side; and there could be heard a succession of snores, produced by the National Guards, whose stomachs were outlined through the darkness in a confused fashion. On the top of the stove stood an empty bottle and some plates. Three straw chairs were drawn around the table, on which a pack of cards was displayed. A drum, in the middle of the bench, let its strap hang down.\n\nA warm breath of air making its way through the door caused the lamp to smoke. Arnoux slept with his two arms wide apart; and, as his gun was placed in a slightly crooked position, with the butt-end downward, the mouth of the barrel came up right under his arm. Frederick noticed this, and was alarmed.\n\n\"But, no, I'm wrong, there's nothing to be afraid of! And yet, suppose he met his death!\"\n\nAnd immediately pictures unrolled themselves before his mind in endless succession.\n\nHe saw himself with her at night in a post-chaise, then on a river's bank on a summer's evening, and under the reflection of a lamp at home in their own house. He even fixed his attention on household expenses and domestic arrangements, contemplating, feeling already his happiness between his hands; and in order to realise it, all that was needed was that the cock of the gun should rise. The end of it could be pushed with one's toe, the gun would go off\u2014it would be a mere accident\u2014nothing more!\n\nFrederick brooded over this idea like a playwright in the agonies of composition. Suddenly it seemed to him that it was not far from being carried into practical operation, and that he was going to contribute to that result\u2014that, in fact, he was yearning for it; and then a feeling of absolute terror took possession of him. In the midst of this mental distress he experienced a sense of pleasure, and he allowed himself to sink deeper and deeper into it, with a dreadful consciousness all the time that his scruples were vanishing. In the wildness of his reverie the rest of the world became effaced, and he could only realise that he was still alive from the intolerable oppression on his chest.\n\n\"Let us take a drop of white wine!\" said the refiner, as he awoke.\n\nArnoux sprang to his feet, and, as soon as the white wine was swallowed, he wanted to relieve Frederick of his sentry duty.\n\nThen he brought him to have breakfast in the Rue de Chartres, at Parly's, and as he required to recuperate his energies, he ordered two dishes of meat, a lobster, an omelet with rum, a salad, etc., and finished this off with a brand of Sauterne of 1819 and one of '42 Roman\u00e9e, not to speak of the champagne at dessert and the liqueurs.\n\nFrederick did not in any way gainsay him. He was disturbed in mind as if by the thought that the other might somehow trace on his countenance the idea that had lately flitted before his imagination. With both elbows on the table and his head bent forward, so that he annoyed Frederick by his fixed stare, he confided some of his hobbies to the young man.\n\nHe wanted to take for farming purposes all the embankments on the Northern line, in order to plant potatoes there, or else to organise on the boulevards a monster cavalcade in which the celebrities of the period would figure. He would let all the windows, which would, at the rate of three francs for each person, produce a handsome profit. In short, he dreamed of a great stroke of fortune by means of a monopoly. He assumed a moral tone, nevertheless, found fault with excesses and all sorts of misconduct, spoke about his \"poor father,\" and every evening, as he said, made an examination of his conscience before offering his soul to God.\n\n\"A little cura\u00e7ao, eh?\"\n\n\"Just as you please.\"\n\nAs for the Republic, things would right themselves; in fact, he looked on himself as the happiest man on earth; and forgetting himself, he exalted Rosanette's attractive qualities, and even compared her with his wife. It was quite a different thing. You could not imagine a lovelier person!\n\n\"Your health!\"\n\nFrederick touched glasses with him. He had, out of complaisance, drunk a little too much. Besides, the strong sunlight dazzled him; and when they went up the Rue Vivienne together again, their shoulders touched each other in a fraternal fashion.\n\nWhen he got home, Frederick slept till seven o'clock. After that he called on the Mar\u00e9chale. She had gone out with somebody\u2014with Arnoux, perhaps! Not knowing what to do with himself, he continued his promenade along the boulevard, but could not get past the Porte Saint-Martin, owing to the great crowd that blocked the way.\n\nWant had abandoned to their own resources a considerable number of workmen, and they used to come there every evening, no doubt for the purpose of holding a review and awaiting a signal.\n\nIn spite of the law against riotous assemblies, these clubs of despair increased to a frightful extent, and many citizens repaired every day to the spot through bravado, and because it was the fashion.\n\nAll of a sudden Frederick caught a glimpse, three paces away, of M. Dambreuse along with Martinon. He turned his head away, for M. Dambreuse having got himself nominated as a representative of the people, he cherished a secret spite against him. But the capitalist stopped him.\n\n\"One word, my dear monsieur! I have some explanations to make to you.\"\n\n\"I am not asking you for any.\"\n\n\"Pray listen to me!\"\n\nIt was not his fault in any way. Appeals had been made to him; pressure had, to a certain extent, been placed on him. Martinon immediately endorsed all that he had said. Some of the electors of Nogent had presented themselves in a deputation at his house.\n\n\"Besides, I expected to be free as soon as\u2014\u2014\"\n\nA crush of people on the footpath forced M. Dambreuse to get out of the way. A minute after he reappeared, saying to Martinon:\n\n\"This is a genuine service, really, and you won't have any reason to regret\u2014\u2014\"\n\nAll three stood with their backs resting against a shop in order to be able to chat more at their ease.\n\nFrom time to time there was a cry of, \"Long live Napol\u00e9on! Long live Barb\u00e8s! Down with Marie!\"\n\nThe countless throng kept talking in very loud tones; and all these voices, echoing through the houses, made, so to speak, the continuous ripple of waves in a harbour. At intervals they ceased; and then could be heard voices singing the \"Marseillaise.\"\n\nUnder the court-gates, men of mysterious aspect offered sword-sticks to those who passed. Sometimes two individuals, one of whom preceded the other, would wink, and then quickly hurry away. The footpaths were filled with groups of staring idlers. A dense crowd swayed to and fro on the pavement. Entire bands of police-officers, emerging from the alleys, had scarcely made their way into the midst of the multitude when they were swallowed up in the mass of people. Little red flags here and there looked like flames. Coachmen, from the place where they sat high up, gesticulated energetically, and then turned to go back. It was a case of perpetual movement\u2014one of the strangest sights that could be conceived.\n\n\"How all this,\" said Martinon, \"would have amused Mademoiselle C\u00e9cile!\"\n\n\"My wife, as you are aware, does not like my niece to come with us,\" returned M. Dambreuse with a smile.\n\nOne could scarcely recognise in him the same man. For the past three months he had been crying, \"Long live the Republic!\" and he had even voted in favour of the banishment of Orl\u00e9ans. But there should be an end of concessions. He exhibited his rage so far as to carry a tomahawk in his pocket.\n\nMartinon had one, too. The magistracy not being any longer irremovable, he had withdrawn from Parquet, so that he surpassed M. Dambreuse in his display of violence.\n\nThe banker had a special antipathy to Lamartine (for having supported Ledru-Rollin) and, at the same time, to Pierre Leroux, Proudhon, Consid\u00e9rant, Lamennais, and all the cranks, all the Socialists.\n\n\"For, in fact, what is it they want? The duty on meat and arrest for debt have been abolished. Now the project of a bank for mortgages is under consideration; the other day it was a national bank; and here are five millions in the Budget for the working-men! But luckily, it is over, thanks to Monsieur de Falloux! Good-bye to them! let them go!\"\n\nIn fact, not knowing how to maintain the three hundred thousand men in the national workshops, the Minister of Public Works had that very day signed an order inviting all citizens between the ages of eighteen and twenty to take service as soldiers, or else to start for the provinces to cultivate the ground there.\n\nThey were indignant at the alternative thus put before them, convinced that the object was to destroy the Republic. They were aggrieved by the thought of having to live at a distance from the capital, as if it were a kind of exile. They saw themselves dying of fevers in desolate parts of the country. To many of them, moreover, who had been accustomed to work of a refined description, agriculture seemed a degradation; it was, in short, a mockery, a decisive breach of all the promises which had been made to them. If they offered any resistance, force would be employed against them. They had no doubt of it, and made preparations to anticipate it.\n\nAbout nine o'clock the riotous assemblies which had formed at the Bastille and at the Ch\u00e2telet ebbed back towards the boulevard. From the Porte Saint-Denis to the Porte Saint-Martin nothing could be seen save an enormous swarm of people, a single mass of a dark blue shade, nearly black. The men of whom one caught a glimpse all had glowing eyes, pale complexions, faces emaciated with hunger and excited with a sense of wrong.\n\nMeanwhile, some clouds had gathered. The tempestuous sky roused the electricity that was in the people, and they kept whirling about of their own accord with the great swaying movements of a swelling sea, and one felt that there was an incalculable force in the depths of this excited throng, and as it were, the energy of an element. Then they all began exclaiming: \"Lamps! lamps!\" Many windows had no illumination, and stones were flung at the panes. M. Dambreuse deemed it prudent to withdraw from the scene. The two young men accompanied him home. He predicted great disasters. The people might once more invade the Chamber, and on this point he told them how he should have been killed on the fifteenth of May had it not been for the devotion of a National Guard.\n\n\"But I had forgotten! he is a friend of yours\u2014your friend the earthenware manufacturer\u2014Jacques Arnoux!\" The rioters had been actually throttling him, when that brave citizen caught him in his arms and put him safely out of their reach.\n\nSo it was that, since then, there had been a kind of intimacy between them.\n\n\"It would be necessary, one of these days, to dine together, and, since you often see him, give him the assurance that I like him very much. He is an excellent man, and has, in my opinion, been slandered; and he has his wits about him in the morning. My compliments once more! A very good evening!\"\n\nFrederick, after he had quitted M. Dambreuse, went back to the Mar\u00e9chale, and, in a very gloomy fashion, said that she should choose between him and Arnoux. She replied that she did not understand \"dumps of this sort,\" that she did not care about Arnoux, and had no desire to cling to him. Frederick was thirsting to fly from Paris. She did not offer any opposition to this whim; and next morning they set out for Fontainebleau.\n\nThe hotel at which they stayed could be distinguished from others by a fountain that rippled in the middle of the courtyard attached to it. The doors of the various apartments opened out on a corridor, as in monasteries. The room assigned to them was large, well-furnished, hung with print, and noiseless, owing to the scarcity of tourists. Alongside the houses, people who had nothing to do kept passing up and down; then, under their windows, when the day was declining, children in the street would engage in a game of base; and this tranquillity, following so soon the tumult they had witnessed in Paris, filled them with astonishment and exercised over them a soothing influence.\n\nEvery morning at an early hour, they went to pay a visit to the ch\u00e2teau. As they passed in through the gate, they had a view of its entire front, with the five pavilions covered with sharp-pointed roofs, and its staircase of horseshoe-shape opening out to the end of the courtyard, which is hemmed in, to right and left, by two main portions of the building further down. On the paved ground lichens blended their colours here and there with the tawny hue of bricks, and the entire appearance of the palace, rust-coloured like old armour, had about it something of the impassiveness of royalty\u2014a sort of warlike, melancholy grandeur.\n\nAt last, a man-servant made his appearance with a bunch of keys in his hand. He first showed them the apartments of the queens, the Pope's oratory, the gallery of Francis I., the mahogany table on which the Emperor signed his abdication, and in one of the rooms cut in two the old Galerie des Cerfs, the place where Christine got Monaldeschi assassinated. Rosanette listened to this narrative attentively, then, turning towards Frederick:\n\n\"No doubt it was through jealousy? Mind yourself!\" After this they passed through the Council Chamber, the Guards' Room, the Throne Room, and the drawing-room of Louis XIII. The uncurtained windows sent forth a white light. The handles of the window-fastenings and the copper feet of the pier-tables were slightly tarnished with dust. The armchairs were everywhere hidden under coarse linen covers. Above the doors could be seen reliquaries of Louis XIV., and here and there hangings representing the gods of Olympus, Psyche, or the battles of Alexander.\n\nAs she was passing in front of the mirrors, Rosanette stopped for a moment to smooth her head-bands.\n\nAfter passing through the donjon-court and the Saint-Saturnin Chapel, they reached the Festal Hall.\n\nThey were dazzled by the magnificence of the ceiling, which was divided into octagonal apartments set off with gold and silver, more finely chiselled than a jewel, and by the vast number of paintings covering the walls, from the immense chimney-piece, where the arms of France were surrounded by crescents and quivers, down to the musicians' gallery, which had been erected at the other end along the entire width of the hall. The ten arched windows were wide open; the sun threw its lustre on the pictures, so that they glowed beneath its rays; the blue sky continued in an endless curve the ultramarine of the arches; and from the depths of the woods, where the lofty summits of the trees filled up the horizon, there seemed to come an echo of flourishes blown by ivory trumpets, and mythological ballets, gathering together under the foliage princesses and nobles disguised as nymphs or fauns\u2014an epoch of ingenuous science, of violent passions, and sumptuous art, when the ideal was to sweep away the world in a vision of the Hesperides, and when the mistresses of kings mingled their glory with the stars. There was a portrait of one of the most beautiful of these celebrated women in the form of Diana the huntress, and even the Infernal Diana, no doubt in order to indicate the power which she possessed even beyond the limits of the tomb. All these symbols confirmed her glory, and there remained about the spot something of her, an indistinct voice, a radiation that stretched out indefinitely. A feeling of mysterious retrospective voluptuousness took possession of Frederick.\n\nIn order to divert these passionate longings into another channel, he began to gaze tenderly on Rosanette, and asked her would she not like to have been this woman?\n\n\"What woman?\"\n\n\"Diane de Poitiers!\"\n\nHe repeated:\n\n\"Diane de Poitiers, the mistress of Henry II.\"\n\nShe gave utterance to a little \"Ah!\" that was all.\n\nHer silence clearly demonstrated that she knew nothing about the matter, and had failed to comprehend his meaning, so that out of complaisance he said to her:\n\n\"Perhaps you are getting tired of this?\"\n\n\"No, no\u2014quite the reverse.\" And lifting up her chin, and casting around her a glance of the vaguest description, Rosanette let these words escape her lips:\n\n\"It recalls some memories to me!\"\n\nMeanwhile, it was easy to trace on her countenance a strained expression, a certain sense of awe; and, as this air of gravity made her look all the prettier, Frederick overlooked it.\n\nThe carps' pond amused her more. For a quarter of an hour she kept flinging pieces of bread into the water in order to see the fishes skipping about.\n\nFrederick had seated himself by her side under the linden-trees. He saw in imagination all the personages who had haunted these walls\u2014Charles V., the Valois Kings, Henry IV., Peter the Great, Jean Jacques Rousseau, and \"the fair mourners of the stage-boxes,\" Voltaire, Napol\u00e9on, Pius VII., and Louis Philippe; and he felt himself environed, elbowed, by these tumultuous dead people. He was stunned by such a confusion of historic figures, even though he found a certain fascination in contemplating them, nevertheless.\n\nAt length they descended into the flower-garden.\n\nIt is a vast rectangle, which presents to the spectator, at the first glance, its wide yellow walks, its square grass-plots, its ribbons of box-wood, its yew-trees shaped like pyramids, its low-lying green swards, and its narrow borders, in which thinly-sown flowers make spots on the grey soil. At the end of the garden may be seen a park through whose entire length a canal makes its way.\n\nRoyal residences have attached to them a peculiar kind of melancholy, due, no doubt, to their dimensions being much too large for the limited number of guests entertained within them, to the silence which one feels astonished to find in them after so many flourishes of trumpets, to the immobility of their luxurious furniture, which attests by the aspect of age and decay it gradually assumes the transitory character of dynasties, the eternal wretchedness of all things; and this exhalation of the centuries, enervating and funereal, like the perfume of a mummy, makes itself felt even in untutored brains. Rosanette yawned immoderately. They went back to the hotel.\n\nAfter their breakfast an open carriage came round for them. They started from Fontainebleau at a point where several roads diverged, then went up at a walking pace a gravelly road leading towards a little pine-wood. The trees became larger, and, from time to time, the driver would say, \"This is the Fr\u00e8res Siamois, the Pharamond, the Bouquet de Roi,\" not forgetting a single one of these notable sites, sometimes even drawing up to enable them to admire the scene.\n\nThey entered the forest of Franchard. The carriage glided over the grass like a sledge; pigeons which they could not see began cooing. Suddenly, the waiter of a caf\u00e9 made his appearance, and they alighted before the railing of a garden in which a number of round tables were placed. Then, passing on the left by the walls of a ruined abbey, they made their way over big boulders of stone, and soon reached the lower part of the gorge.\n\nIt is covered on one side with sandstones and juniper-trees tangled together, while on the other side the ground, almost quite bare, slopes towards the hollow of the valley, where a foot-track makes a pale line through the brown heather; and far above could be traced a flat cone-shaped summit with a telegraph-tower behind it.\n\nHalf-an-hour later they stepped out of the vehicle once more, in order to climb the heights of Aspremont.\n\nThe roads form zigzags between the thick-set pine-trees under rocks with angular faces. All this corner of the forest has a sort of choked-up look\u2014a rather wild and solitary aspect. One thinks of hermits in connection with it\u2014companions of huge stags with fiery crosses between their horns, who were wont to welcome with paternal smiles the good kings of France when they knelt before their grottoes. The warm air was filled with a resinous odour, and roots of trees crossed one another like veins close to the soil. Rosanette slipped over them, grew dejected, and felt inclined to shed tears.\n\nBut, at the very top, she became joyous once more on finding, under a roof made of branches, a sort of tavern where carved wood was sold. She drank a bottle of lemonade, and bought a holly-stick; and, without one glance towards the landscape which disclosed itself from the plateau, she entered the Brigands' Cave, with a waiter carrying a torch in front of her. Their carriage was awaiting them in the Bas Breau.\n\nA painter in a blue blouse was working at the foot of an oak-tree with his box of colours on his knees. He raised his head and watched them as they passed.\n\nIn the middle of the hill of Chailly, the sudden breaking of a cloud caused them to turn up the hoods of their cloaks. Almost immediately the rain stopped, and the paving-stones of the street glistened under the sun when they were re-entering the town.\n\nSome travellers, who had recently arrived, informed them that a terrible battle had stained Paris with blood. Rosanette and her lover were not surprised. Then everybody left; the hotel became quiet, the gas was put out, and they were lulled to sleep by the murmur of the fountain in the courtyard.\n\nOn the following day they went to see the Wolf's Gorge, the Fairies' Pool, the Long Rock, and the Marlotte.[G] Two days later, they began again at random, just as their coachman thought fit to drive them, without asking where they were, and often even neglecting the famous sites.\n\nThey felt so comfortable in their old landau, low as a sofa, and covered with a rug made of a striped material which was quite faded. The moats, filled with brushwood, stretched out under their eyes with a gentle, continuous movement. White rays passed like arrows through the tall ferns. Sometimes a road that was no longer used presented itself before them, in a straight line, and here and there might be seen a feeble growth of weeds. In the centre between four cross-roads, a crucifix extended its four arms. In other places, stakes were bending down like dead trees, and little curved paths, which were lost under the leaves, made them feel a longing to pursue them. At the same moment the horse turned round; they  entered there; they plunged into the mire. Further down moss had sprouted out at the sides of the deep ruts.\n\nThey believed that they were far away from all other people, quite alone. But suddenly a game-keeper with his gun, or a band of women in rags with big bundles of fagots on their backs, would hurry past them.\n\nWhen the carriage stopped, there was a universal silence. The only sounds that reached them were the blowing of the horse in the shafts with the faint cry of a bird more than once repeated.\n\nThe light at certain points illuminating the outskirts of the wood, left the interior in deep shadow, or else, attenuated in the foreground by a sort of twilight, it exhibited in the background violet vapours, a white radiance. The midday sun, falling directly on wide tracts of greenery, made splashes of light over them, hung gleaming drops of silver from the ends of the branches, streaked the grass with long lines of emeralds, and flung gold spots on the beds of dead leaves. When they let their heads fall back, they could distinguish the sky through the tops of the trees. Some of them, which were enormously high, looked like patriarchs or emperors, or, touching one another at their extremities formed with their long shafts, as it were, triumphal arches; others, sprouting forth obliquely from below, seemed like falling columns. This heap of big vertical lines gaped open. Then, enormous green billows unrolled themselves in unequal embossments as far as the surface of the valleys, towards which advanced the brows of other hills looking down on white plains, which ended by losing themselves in an undefined pale tinge.\n\nStanding side by side, on some rising ground, they felt, as they drank in the air, the pride of a life more free penetrating into the depths of their souls, with a superabundance of energy, a joy which they could not explain.\n\nThe variety of trees furnished a spectacle of the most diversified character. The beeches with their smooth white bark twisted their tops together. Ash trees softly curved their bluish branches. In the tufts of the hornbeams rose up holly stiff as bronze. Then came a row of thin birches, bent into elegiac attitudes; and the pine-trees, symmetrical as organ pipes, seemed to be singing a song as they swayed to and fro. There were gigantic oaks with knotted forms, which had been violently shaken, stretched themselves out from the soil and pressed close against each other, and with firm trunks resembling torsos, launched forth to heaven despairing appeals with their bare arms and furious threats, like a group of Titans struck motionless in the midst of their rage. An atmosphere of gloom, a feverish languor, brooded over the pools, whose sheets of water were cut into flakes by the overshadowing thorn-trees. The lichens on their banks, where the wolves come to drink, are of the colour of sulphur, burnt, as it were, by the footprints of witches, and the incessant croaking of the frogs responds to the cawing of the crows as they wheel through the air. After this they passed through the monotonous glades, planted here and there with a staddle. The sound of iron falling with a succession of rapid blows could be heard. On the side of the hill a group of quarrymen were breaking the rocks. These rocks became more and more numerous and finally filled up the entire landscape, cube-shaped like houses, flat like flagstones, propping up, overhanging, and became intermingled with each other, as if they were the ruins, unrecognisable and monstrous, of some vanished city. But the wild chaos they exhibited made one rather dream of volcanoes, of deluges, of great unknown cataclysms. Frederick said they had been there since the beginning of the world, and would remain so till the end. Rosanette turned aside her head, declaring that this would drive her out of her mind, and went off to collect sweet heather. The little violet blossoms, heaped up near one another, formed unequal plates, and the soil, which was giving way underneath, placed soft dark fringes on the sand spangled with mica.\n\nOne day they reached a point half-way up a hill, where the soil was full of sand. Its surface, untrodden till now, was streaked so as to resemble symmetrical waves. Here and there, like promontories on the dry bed of an ocean, rose up rocks with the vague outlines of animals, tortoises thrusting forward their heads, crawling seals, hippopotami, and bears. Not a soul around them. Not a single sound. The shingle glowed under the dazzling rays of the sun, and all at once in this vibration of light the specimens of the brute creation that met their gaze began to move about. They returned home quickly, flying from the dizziness that had seized hold of them, almost dismayed.\n\nThe gravity of the forest exercised an influence over them, and hours passed in silence, during which, allowing themselves to yield to the lulling effects of springs, they remained as it were sunk in the torpor of a calm intoxication. With his arm around her waist, he listened to her talking while the birds were warbling, noticed with the same glance the black grapes on her bonnet and the juniper-berries, the draperies of her veil, and the spiral forms assumed by the clouds, and when he bent towards her the freshness of her skin mingled with the strong perfume of the woods. They found amusement in everything. They showed one another, as a curiosity, gossamer threads of the Virgin hanging from bushes, holes full of water in the middle of stones, a squirrel on the branches, the way in which two butterflies kept flying after them; or else, at twenty paces from them, under the trees, a hind strode on peacefully, with an air of nobility and gentleness, its doe walking by its side.\n\nRosanette would have liked to run after it to embrace it.\n\nShe got very much alarmed once, when a man suddenly presenting himself, showed her three vipers in a box. She wildly flung herself on Frederick's breast. He felt happy at the thought that she was weak and that he was strong enough to defend her.\n\nThat evening they dined at an inn on the banks of the Seine. The table was near the window, Rosanette sitting opposite him, and he contemplated her little well-shaped white nose, her turned-up lips, her bright eyes, the swelling bands of her nut-brown hair, and her pretty oval face. Her dress of raw silk clung to her somewhat drooping shoulders, and her two hands, emerging from their sleeves, joined close together as if they were one\u2014carved, poured out wine, moved over the table-cloth. The waiters placed before them a chicken with its four limbs stretched out, a stew of eels in a dish of pipe-clay, wine that had got spoiled, bread that was too hard, and knives with notches in them. All these things made the repast more enjoyable and strengthened the illusion. They fancied that they were in the middle of a journey in Italy on their honeymoon. Before starting again they went for a walk along the bank of the river.\n\nThe soft blue sky, rounded like a dome, leaned at the horizon on the indentations of the woods. On the opposite side, at the end of the meadow, there was a village steeple; and further away, to the left, the roof of a house made a red spot on the river, which wound its way without any apparent motion. Some rushes bent over it, however, and the water lightly shook some poles fixed at its edge in order to hold nets. An osier bow-net and two or three old fishing-boats might be seen there. Near the inn a girl in a straw hat was drawing buckets out of a well. Every time they came up again, Frederick heard the grating sound of the chain with a feeling of inexpressible delight.\n\nHe had no doubt that he would be happy till the end of his days, so natural did his felicity appear to him, so much a part of his life, and so intimately associated with this woman's being. He was irresistibly impelled to address her with words of endearment. She answered with pretty little speeches, light taps on the shoulder, displays of tenderness that charmed him by their unexpectedness. He discovered in her quite a new sort of beauty, in fact, which was perhaps only the reflection of surrounding things, unless it happened to bud forth from their hidden potentialities.\n\nWhen they were lying down in the middle of the field, he would stretch himself out with his head on her lap, under the shelter of her parasol; or else with their faces turned towards the green sward, in the centre of which they rested, they kept gazing towards one another so that their pupils seemed to intermingle, thirsting for one another and ever satiating their thirst, and then with half-closed eyelids they lay side by side without uttering a single word.\n\nNow and then the distant rolling of a drum reached their ears. It was the signal-drum which was being beaten in the different villages calling on people to go and defend Paris.\n\n\"Oh! look here! 'tis the rising!\" said Frederick, with a disdainful pity, all this excitement now presenting to his mind a pitiful aspect by the side of their love and of eternal nature.\n\nAnd they talked about whatever happened to come into their heads, things that were perfectly familiar to them, persons in whom they took no interest, a thousand trifles. She chatted with him about her chambermaid and her hairdresser. One day she was so self-forgetful that she told him her age\u2014twenty-nine years. She was becoming quite an old woman.\n\nSeveral times, without intending it, she gave him some particulars with reference to her own life. She had been a \"shop girl,\" had taken a trip to England, and had begun studying for the stage; all this she told without any explanation of how these changes had come about; and he found it impossible to reconstruct her entire history.\n\nShe related to him more about herself one day when they were seated side by side under a plane-tree at the back of a meadow. At the road-side, further down, a little barefooted girl, standing amid a heap of dust, was making a cow go to pasture. As soon as she caught sight of them she came up to beg, and while with one hand she held up her tattered petticoat, she kept scratching with the other her black hair, which, like a wig of Louis XIV.'s time, curled round her dark face, lighted by a magnificent pair of eyes.\n\n\"She will be very pretty by-and-by,\" said Frederick.\n\n\"How lucky she is, if she has no mother!\" remarked Rosanette.\n\n\"Eh? How is that?\"\n\n\"Certainly. I, if it were not for mine\u2014\u2014\"\n\nShe sighed, and began to speak about her childhood. Her parents were weavers in the Croix-Rousse. She acted as an apprentice to her father. In vain did the poor man wear himself out with hard work; his wife was continually abusing him, and sold everything for drink. Rosanette could see, as if it were yesterday, the room they occupied with the looms ranged lengthwise against the windows, the pot boiling on the stove, the bed painted like mahogany, a cupboard facing it, and the obscure loft where she used to sleep up to the time when she was fifteen years old. At length a gentleman made his appearance on the scene\u2014a fat man with a face of the colour of boxwood, the manners of a devotee, and a suit of black clothes. Her mother and this man had a conversation together, with the result that three days afterwards\u2014Rosanette stopped, and with a look in which there was as much bitterness as shamelessness:\n\n\"It was done!\"\n\nThen, in response to a gesture of Frederick.\n\n\"As he was married (he would have been afraid of compromising himself in his own house), I was brought to a private room in a restaurant, and told that I would be happy, that I would get a handsome present.\n\n\"At the door, the first thing that struck me was a candelabrum of vermilion on a table, on which there were two covers. A mirror on the ceiling showed their reflections, and the blue silk hangings on the walls made the entire apartment resemble an alcove; I was seized with astonishment. You understand\u2014a poor creature who had never seen anything before. In spite of my dazed condition of mind, I got frightened. I wanted to go away. However, I remained.\n\n\"The only seat in the room was a sofa close beside the table. It was so soft that it gave way under me. The mouth of the hot-air stove in the middle of the carpet sent out towards me a warm breath, and there I sat without taking anything. The waiter, who was standing near me, urged me to eat. He poured out for me immediately a large glass of wine. My head began to swim, I wanted to open the window. He said to me:\n\n\"'No, Mademoiselle! that is forbidden.'\"\n\n\"And he left me.\n\n\"The table was covered with a heap of things that I had no knowledge of. Nothing there seemed to me good. Then I fell back on a pot of jam, and patiently waited. I did not know what prevented him from coming. It was very late\u2014midnight at last\u2014I couldn't bear the fatigue any longer. While pushing aside one of the pillows, in order to hear better, I found under my hand a kind of album\u2014a  book of engravings, they were vulgar pictures. I was sleeping on top of it when he entered the room.\"\n\nShe hung down her head and remained pensive.\n\nThe leaves rustled around them. Amid the tangled grass a great foxglove was swaying to and fro. The sunlight flowed like a wave over the green expanse, and the silence was interrupted at intervals by the browsing of the cow, which they could no longer see.\n\nRosanette kept her eyes fixed on a particular spot, three paces away from her, her nostrils heaving, and her mind absorbed in thought. Frederick caught hold of her hand.\n\n\"How you suffered, poor darling!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said she, \"more than you imagine! So much so that I wanted to make an end of it\u2014they had to fish me up!\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Ah! think no more about it! I love you, I am happy! kiss me!\"\n\nAnd she picked off, one by one, the sprigs of the thistles which clung to the hem of her gown.\n\nFrederick was thinking more than all on what she had not told him. What were the means by which she had gradually emerged from wretchedness? To what lover did she owe her education? What had occurred in her life down to the day when he first came to her house? Her latest avowal was a bar to these questions. All he asked her was how she had made Arnoux's acquaintance.\n\n\"Through the Vatnaz.\"\n\n\"Wasn't it you that I once saw with both of them at the Palais-Royal?\"\n\nHe referred to the exact date. Rosanette made a movement which showed a sense of deep pain.\n\n\"Yes, it is true! I was not gay at that time!\"\n\nBut Arnoux had proved himself a very good fellow. Frederick had no doubt of it. However, their friend was a queer character, full of faults. He took care to recall them. She quite agreed with him on this point.\n\n\"Never mind! One likes him, all the same, this camel!\"\n\n\"Still\u2014even now?\" said Frederick.\n\nShe began to redden, half smiling, half angry.\n\n\"Oh, no! that's an old story. I don't keep anything hidden from you. Even though it might be so, with him it is different. Besides, I don't think you are nice towards your victim!\"\n\n\"My victim!\"\n\nRosanette caught hold of his chin.\n\n\"No doubt!\"\n\nAnd in the lisping fashion in which nurses talk to babies:\n\n\"Have always been so good! Never went a-by-by with his wife?\"\n\n\"I! never at any time!\"\n\nRosanette smiled. He felt hurt by this smile of hers, which seemed to him a proof of indifference.\n\nBut she went on gently, and with one of those looks which seem to appeal for a denial of the truth:\n\n\"Are you perfectly certain?\"\n\n\"Not a doubt of it!\"\n\nFrederick solemnly declared on his word of honour that he had never bestowed a thought on Madame Arnoux, as he was too much in love with another woman.\n\n\"Why, with you, my beautiful one!\"\n\n\"Ah! don't laugh at me! You only annoy me!\"\n\nHe thought it a prudent course to invent a story\u2014to pretend that he was swayed by a passion. He manufactured some circumstantial details. This woman, however, had rendered him very unhappy.\n\n\"Decidedly, you have not been lucky,\" said Rosanette.\n\n\"Oh! oh! I may have been!\" wishing to convey in this way that he had been often fortunate in his love-affairs, so that she might have a better opinion of him, just as Rosanette did not avow how many lovers she had had, in order that he might have more respect for her\u2014for there will always be found in the midst of the most intimate confidences restrictions, false shame, delicacy, and pity. You divine either in the other or in yourself precipices or miry paths which prevent you from penetrating any farther; moreover, you feel that you will not be understood. It is hard to express accurately the thing you mean, whatever it may be; and this is the reason why perfect unions are rare.\n\nThe poor Mar\u00e9chale had never known one better than this. Often, when she gazed at Frederick, tears came into her eyes; then she would raise them or cast a glance towards the horizon, as if she saw there some bright dawn, perspectives of boundless felicity. At last, she confessed one day to him that she wished to have a mass said, \"so that it might bring a blessing on our love.\"\n\nHow was it, then, that she had resisted him so long? She could not tell herself. He repeated his question a great many times; and she replied, as she clasped him in her arms:\n\n\"It was because I was afraid, my darling, of loving you too well!\"\n\nOn Sunday morning, Frederick read, amongst the list of the wounded given in a newspaper, the name of Dussardier. He uttered a cry, and showing the paper to Rosanette, declared that he was going to start at once for Paris.\n\n\"For what purpose?\"\n\n\"In order to see him, to nurse him!\"\n\n\"You are not going, I'm sure, to leave me by myself?\"\n\n\"Come with me!\"\n\n\"Ha! to poke my nose in a squabble of that sort? Oh, no, thanks!\"\n\n\"However, I cannot\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\"Ta! ta! ta! as if they had need of nurses in the hospitals! And then, what concern is he of yours any longer? Everyone for himself!\"\n\nHe was roused to indignation by this egoism on her part, and he reproached himself for not being in the capital with the others. Such indifference to the misfortunes of the nation had in it something shabby, and only worthy of a small shopkeeper. And now, all of a sudden, his intrigue with Rosanette weighed on his mind as if it were a crime. For an hour they were quite cool towards each other.\n\nThen she appealed to him to wait, and not expose himself to danger.\n\n\"Suppose you happen to be killed?\"\n\n\"Well, I should only have done my duty!\"\n\nRosanette gave a jump. His first duty was to love her; but, no doubt, he did not care about her any longer. There was no common sense in what he was going to do. Good heavens! what an idea!\n\nFrederick rang for his bill. But to get back to Pans was not an easy matter. The Leloir stagecoach had just left; the Lecomte berlins would not be starting; the diligence from Bourbonnais would not be passing till a late hour that night, and perhaps it might be full, one could never tell. When he had lost a great deal of time in making enquiries about the various modes of conveyance, the idea occurred to him to travel post. The master of the post-house refused to supply him with horses, as Frederick had no passport. Finally, he hired an open carriage\u2014the same one in which they had driven about the country\u2014and at about five o'clock they arrived in front of the H\u00f4tel du Commerce at Melun.\n\nThe market-place was covered with piles of arms. The prefect had forbidden the National Guards to proceed towards Paris. Those who did not belong to his department wished to go on. There was a great deal of shouting, and the inn was packed with a noisy crowd.\n\nRosanette, seized with terror, said she would not go a step further, and once more begged of him to stay. The innkeeper and his wife joined in her entreaties. A decent sort of man who happened to be dining there interposed, and observed that the fighting would be over in a very short time. Besides, one ought to do his duty. Thereupon the Mar\u00e9chale redoubled her sobs. Frederick got exasperated. He handed her his purse, kissed her quickly, and disappeared.\n\nOn reaching Corbeil, he learned at the station that the insurgents had cut the rails at regular distances, and the coachman refused to drive him any farther; he said that his horses were \"overspent.\"\n\nThrough his influence, however, Frederick managed to procure an indifferent cabriolet, which, for the sum of sixty francs, without taking into account the price of a drink for the driver, was to convey him as far as the Italian barrier. But at a hundred paces from the barrier his coachman made him descend and turn back. Frederick was walking along the pathway, when suddenly a sentinel thrust out his bayonet. Four men seized him, exclaiming:\n\n\"This is one of them! Look out! Search him! Brigand! scoundrel!\"\n\nAnd he was so thoroughly stupefied that he let himself be dragged to the guard-house of the barrier, at the very point where the Boulevards des Gobelins and de l'H\u00f4pital and Rues Godefroy and Mauffetard converge.\n\nFour barricades formed at the ends of four different ways enormous sloping ramparts of paving-stones. Torches were glimmering here and there. In spite of the rising clouds of dust he could distinguish foot-soldiers of the Line and National Guards, all with their faces blackened, their chests uncovered, and an aspect of wild excitement. They had just captured the square, and had shot down a number of men. Their rage had not yet cooled. Frederick said he had come from Fontainebleau to the relief of a wounded comrade who lodged in the Rue Bellefond. Not one of them would believe him at first. They examined his hands; they even put their noses to his ear to make sure that he did not smell of powder.\n\nHowever, by dint of repeating the same thing, he finally satisfied a captain, who directed two fusiliers to conduct him to the guard-house of the Jardin des Plantes. They descended the Boulevard de l'H\u00f4pital. A strong breeze was blowing. It restored him to animation.\n\nAfter this they turned up the Rue du March\u00e9 aux Chevaux. The Jardin des Plantes at the right formed a long black mass, whilst at the left the entire front of the Piti\u00e9, illuminated at every window, blazed like a conflagration, and shadows passed rapidly over the window-panes.\n\nThe two men in charge of Frederick went away. Another accompanied him to the Polytechnic School. The Rue Saint-Victor was quite dark, without a gas-lamp or a light at any window to relieve the gloom. Every ten minutes could be heard the words:\n\n\"Sentinels! mind yourselves!\"\n\nAnd this exclamation, cast into the midst of the silence, was prolonged like the repeated striking of a stone against the side of a chasm as it falls through space.\n\nEvery now and then the stamp of heavy footsteps could be heard drawing nearer. This was nothing less than a patrol consisting of about a hundred men. From this confused mass escaped whisperings and the dull clanking of iron; and, moving away with a rhythmic swing, it melted into the darkness.\n\nIn the middle of the crossing, where several streets met, a dragoon sat motionless on his horse. From time to time an express rider passed at a rapid gallop; then the silence was renewed. Cannons, which were being drawn along the streets, made, on the pavement, a heavy rolling sound that seemed full of menace\u2014a sound different from every ordinary sound\u2014which oppressed the heart. The sounds was profound, unlimited\u2014a black silence. Men in white blouses accosted the soldiers, spoke one or two words to them, and then vanished like phantoms.\n\nThe guard-house of the Polytechnic School overflowed with people. The threshold was blocked up with women, who had come to see their sons or their husbands. They were sent on to the Panth\u00e9on, which had been transformed into a dead-house; and no attention was paid to Frederick. He pressed forward resolutely, solemnly declaring that his friend Dussardier was waiting for him, that he was at death's door. At last they sent a corporal to accompany him to the top of the Rue Saint-Jacques, to the Mayor's office in the twelfth arrondissement.\n\nThe Place du Panth\u00e9on was filled with soldiers lying asleep on straw. The day was breaking; the bivouac-fires were extinguished.\n\nThe insurrection had left terrible traces in this quarter. The soil of the streets, from one end to the other, was covered with risings of various sizes. On the wrecked barricades had been piled up omnibuses, gas-pipes, and cart-wheels. In certain places there were little dark pools, which must have been blood. The houses were riddled with projectiles, and their framework could be seen under the plaster that was peeled off. Window-blinds, each attached only by a single nail, hung like rags. The staircases having fallen in, doors opened on vacancy. The interiors of rooms could be perceived with their papers in strips. In some instances dainty objects had remained in them quite intact. Frederick noticed a timepiece, a parrot-stick, and some engravings.\n\nWhen he entered the Mayor's office, the National Guards were chattering without a moment's pause about the deaths of Br\u00e9a and N\u00e9grier, about the deputy Charbonnel, and about the Archbishop of Paris. He heard them saying that the Duc d'Aumale had landed at Boulogne, that Barb\u00e8s had fled from Vincennes, that the artillery were coming up from Bourges, and that abundant aid was arriving from the provinces. About three o'clock some one brought good news.\n\nTruce-bearers from the insurgents were in conference with the President of the Assembly.\n\nThereupon they all made merry; and as he had a dozen francs left, Frederick sent for a dozen bottles of wine, hoping by this means to hasten his deliverance. Suddenly a discharge of musketry was heard. The drinking stopped. They peered with distrustful eyes into the unknown\u2014it might be Henry V.\n\nIn order to get rid of responsibility, they took Frederick to the Mayor's office in the eleventh arrondissement, which he was not permitted to leave till nine o'clock in the morning.\n\nHe started at a running pace from the Quai Voltaire. At an open window an old man in his shirt-sleeves was crying, with his eyes raised. The Seine glided peacefully along. The sky was of a clear blue; and in the trees round the Tuileries birds were singing.\n\nFrederick was just crossing the Place du Carrousel when a litter happened to be passing by. The soldiers at the guard-house immediately presented arms; and the officer, putting his hand to his shako, said: \"Honour to unfortunate bravery!\" This phrase seemed to have almost become a matter of duty. He who pronounced it appeared to be, on each occasion, filled with profound emotion. A group of people in a state of fierce excitement followed the litter, exclaiming:\n\n\"We will avenge you! we will avenge you!\"\n\nThe vehicles kept moving about on the boulevard, and women were making lint before the doors. Meanwhile, the outbreak had been quelled, or very nearly so. A proclamation from Cavaignac, just posted up, announced the fact. At the top of the Rue Vivienne, a company of the Garde Mobile appeared. Then the citizens uttered cries of enthusiasm. They raised their hats, applauded, danced, wished to embrace them, and to invite them to drink; and flowers, flung by ladies, fell from the balconies.\n\nAt last, at ten o'clock, at the moment when the cannon was booming as an attack was being made on the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, Frederick reached the abode of Dussardier. He found the bookkeeper in his garret, lying asleep on his back. From the adjoining apartment a woman came forth with silent tread\u2014Mademoiselle Vatnaz.\n\nShe led Frederick aside and explained to him how Dussardier had got wounded.\n\nOn Saturday, on the top of a barricade in the Rue Lafayette, a young fellow wrapped in a tricoloured flag cried out to the National Guards: \"Are you going to shoot your brothers?\" As they advanced, Dussardier threw down his gun, pushed away the others, sprang over the barricade, and, with a blow of an old shoe, knocked down the insurgent, from whom he tore the flag. He had afterwards been found under a heap of rubbish with a slug of copper in his thigh. It was found necessary to make an incision in order to extract the projectile. Mademoiselle Vatnaz arrived the same evening, and since then had not quitted his side.\n\nShe intelligently prepared everything that was needed for the dressings, assisted him in taking his medicine or other liquids, attended to his slightest wishes, left and returned again with footsteps more light than those of a fly, and gazed at him with eyes full of tenderness.\n\nFrederick, during the two following weeks, did not fail to come back every morning. One day, while he was speaking about the devotion of the Vatnaz, Dussardier shrugged his shoulders:\n\n\"Oh! no! she does this through interested motives.\"\n\n\"Do you think so?\"\n\nHe replied: \"I am sure of it!\" without seeming disposed to give any further explanation.\n\nShe had loaded him with kindnesses, carrying her attentions so far as to bring him the newspapers in which his gallant action was extolled. He even confessed to Frederick that he felt uneasy in his conscience.\n\nPerhaps he ought to have put himself on the other side with the men in blouses; for, indeed, a heap of promises had been made to them which had not been carried out. Those who had vanquished them hated the Republic; and, in the next place, they had treated them very harshly. No doubt they were in the wrong\u2014not quite, however; and the honest fellow was tormented by the thought that he might have fought against the righteous cause. S\u00e9n\u00e9cal, who was immured in the Tuileries, under the terrace at the water's edge, had none of this mental anguish.\n\nThere were nine hundred men in the place, huddled together in the midst of filth, without the slightest order, their faces blackened with powder and clotted blood, shivering with ague and breaking out into cries of rage, and those who were brought there to die were not separated from the rest. Sometimes, on hearing the sound of a detonation, they believed that they were all going to be shot. Then they dashed themselves against the walls, and after that fell back again into their places, so much stupefied by suffering that it seemed to them that they were living in a nightmare, a mournful hallucination. The lamp, which hung from the arched roof, looked like a stain of blood, and little green and yellow flames fluttered about, caused by the emanations from the vault. Through fear of epidemics, a commission was appointed. When he had advanced a few steps, the President recoiled, frightened by the stench from the excrements and from the corpses.\n\nAs soon as the prisoners drew near a vent-hole, the National Guards who were on sentry, in order to prevent them from shaking the bars of the grating, prodded them indiscriminately with their bayonets.\n\nAs a rule they showed no pity. Those who were not beaten wished to signalise themselves. There was a regular outbreak of fear. They avenged themselves at the same time on newspapers, clubs, mobs, speech-making\u2014everything that had exasperated them during the last three months, and in spite of the victory that had been gained, equality (as if for the punishment of its defenders and the exposure of its enemies to ridicule) manifested itself in a triumphal fashion\u2014an equality of brute beasts, a dead level of sanguinary vileness; for the fanaticism of self-interest balanced the madness of want, aristocracy had the same fits of fury as low debauchery, and the cotton cap did not show itself less hideous than the red cap. The public mind was agitated just as it would be after great convulsions of nature. Sensible men were rendered imbeciles for the rest of their lives on account of it.\n\nP\u00e8re Roque had become very courageous, almost foolhardy. Having arrived on the 26th at Paris with some of the inhabitants of Nogent, instead of going back at the same time with them, he had gone to give his assistance to the National Guard encamped at the Tuileries; and he was quite satisfied to be placed on sentry in front of the terrace at the water's side. There, at any rate, he had these brigands under his feet! He was delighted to find that they were beaten and humiliated, and he could not refrain from uttering invectives against them.\n\nOne of them, a young lad with long fair hair, put his face to the bars, and asked for bread. M. Roque ordered him to hold his tongue. But the young man repeated in a mournful tone:\n\n\"Bread!\"\n\n\"Have I any to give you?\"\n\nOther prisoners presented themselves at the vent-hole, with their bristling beards, their burning eyeballs, all pushing forward, and yelling:\n\n\"Bread!\"\n\nP\u00e8re Roque was indignant at seeing his authority slighted. In order to frighten them he took aim at them; and, borne onward into the vault by the crush that nearly smothered him, the young man, with his head thrown backward, once more exclaimed:\n\n\"Bread!\"\n\n\"Hold on! here it is!\" said P\u00e8re Roque, firing a shot from his gun. There was a fearful howl\u2014then, silence. At the side of the trough something white could be seen lying.\n\nAfter this, M. Roque returned to his abode, for he had a house in the Rue Saint-Martin, which he used as a temporary residence; and the injury done to the front of the building during the riots had in no slight degree contributed to excite his rage. It seemed to him, when he next saw it, that he had exaggerated the amount of damage done to it. His recent act had a soothing effect on him, as if it indemnified him for his loss.\n\nIt was his daughter herself who opened the door for him. She immediately made the remark that she had felt uneasy at his excessively prolonged absence. She was afraid that he had met with some misfortune\u2014that he had been wounded.\n\nThis manifestation of filial love softened P\u00e8re Roque. He was astonished that she should have set out on a journey without Catherine.\n\n\"I sent her out on a message,\" was Louise's reply.\n\nAnd she made enquiries about his health, about one thing or another; then, with an air of indifference, she asked him whether he had chanced to come across Frederick:\n\n\"No; I didn't see him!\"\n\nIt was on his account alone that she had come up from the country.\n\nSome one was walking at that moment in the lobby.\n\n\"Oh! excuse me\u2014\u2014\"\n\nAnd she disappeared.\n\nCatherine had not found Frederick. He had been several days away, and his intimate friend, M. Deslauriers, was now living in the provinces.\n\nLouise once more presented herself, shaking all over, without being able to utter a word. She leaned against the furniture.\n\n\"What's the matter with you? Tell me\u2014what's the matter with you?\" exclaimed her father.\n\nShe indicated by a wave of her hand that it was nothing, and with a great effort of will she regained her composure.\n\nThe keeper of the restaurant at the opposite side of the street brought them soup. But P\u00e8re Roque had passed through too exciting an ordeal to be able to control his emotions. \"He is not likely to die;\" and at dessert he had a sort of fainting fit. A doctor was at once sent for, and he prescribed a potion. Then, when M. Roque was in bed, he asked to be as well wrapped up as possible in order to bring on perspiration. He gasped; he moaned.\n\n\"Thanks, my good Catherine! Kiss your poor father, my chicken! Ah! those revolutions!\"\n\nAnd, when his daughter scolded him for having made himself ill by tormenting his mind on her account, he replied:\n\n\"Yes! you are right! But I couldn't help it! I am too sensitive!\"\n\nFootnotes\n\n[F] This is another political allusion.
