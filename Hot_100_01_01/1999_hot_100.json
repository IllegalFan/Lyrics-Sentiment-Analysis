            "lyrics": "A few days ago, Jennifer Lawrence was the victim of a really awful breach of her privacy where very intimate nude photos of her surfaced online. They were either stolen from her phone or someone hacked into her iCloud. I saw these photos and then I was guilty of posting them on my site without really taking a moment to think about the repercussions of my actions. I was never contacted by her publicist or her lawyer \u2014 I genuinely took the photos down because I stopped and thought about it.\n\nAnd because of you. A lot of you let me know that my actions were wrong. I didn\u2019t even stop to think about my actions. I just wanted to get this out there as soon as possible. I work in celebrity news. Part of my job responsibility is to try to be as quick as possible. I\u2019m not justifying my behavior, I\u2019m just saying I honestly sincerely didn\u2019t stop to think. I wasn\u2019t working with a team, I wasn\u2019t consulting with anyone, \u201coh, should we post this or not?\u201d I was on vacation with my son and my mom in Vegas trying to have a good time. I was like \u201coh my god this huge story is out there, let me get this out there as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nI made the wrong decision, and it was so wrong that some people are viewing me and calling me a rapist and a sex offender. I may not agree with that, but I need to really take a moment and let that sink in because\u2026 I don\u2019t need to be liked by everybody, but I don\u2019t want people viewing me in that light or calling me those things. Call me whatever, but I don\u2019t want to be viewed as a sex offender or a rapist or anything like that.\n\nI\u2019m sorry to Jennifer Lawrence genuinely for my carelessness and I\u2019m going to view this as a good opportunity to learn from and grow from and make some changes going forward. You know, just a week before the Jennifer Lawrence incident, I posted a video of a member of 5 Seconds of Summer, and people weren\u2019t calling me a rapist or a sex offender.\n\nI\u2019m not even trying to make this about me. I\u2019m not making this about me. I am gonna stop talking because I feel like I\u2019m going to shove my foot in my mouth even more. I will just reiterate that I\u2019m genuinely sorry to Jennifer and anybody I\u2019ve done this to in the past and that as a result I\u2019m going to make a change going forward because I want to. If I wanted all this to go away, I would ignore this. That\u2019s one of the rules of publicity: if you want to make things go away, you ignore it. But I want to do what\u2019s right. I want to be better. I want to do better. So going forward I will not post any intimate photos like that, of Jennifer Lawrence or Calum Hood from 5 Seconds of Summer. I just think it\u2019s the right thing to do, for me, for them, for everybody not to perpetuate that. I\u2019m still processing this all. I\u2019m still thinking about it all. I\u2019m still trying to find other ways to make things right, and I apologise to anyone I let down. I genuinely am trying to do better.6Embed",
