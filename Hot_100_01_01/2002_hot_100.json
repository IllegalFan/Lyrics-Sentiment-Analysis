And so, you know, it sounds believable.\n\nAutomated voice\nThis is a Global-Tel link prepaid call from Adnan Syed an inmate at a Maryland Correctional facility. This call will...\nSarah Koenig\nFrom This American Life and WBEZ Chicago it\u2019s Serial. One story told week by week. I\u2019m Sarah Koenig.\nBefore we get to today\u2019s episode where I\u2019m going to let Adnan talk for a while, I want to run by you some new information I\u2019ve learned in the past week. Three things I\u2019ve learned. First, remember Laura, the former Laura Estrada Sandoval the one who asked \u201cwell then who the fuck did it?\u201d in the last episode? She was friends with Stephanie and with Jay and with Adnan. I was talking with Laura on the phone the other day and she mentioned something about Best Buy and so I asked her if I could start taping.\nTell me again what you just told me.\n\nLaura Estrada Sandoval\nThere\u2019s no, there was never any phones at Best Buy. There were never any phones around the Best Buy.\nSarah Koenig\nNo pay phone, no phone booth.\n\n\nLaura Estrada Sandoval\nNo. No there\u2019s like blank. There\u2019s no phones there.\nSarah Koenig\nThe pay phone in question is important because Jay tells the detectives that Adnan called him on January 13, 1999 and told Jay he\u2019d killed Hae. \u201cCome and get me, I\u2019m at Best Buy.\u201d When Jay gets there he says he sees Adnan standing by the phone booth wearing red gloves. He draws a map for the cops showing the location of the phone booth and if you\u2019re facing the front doors of the store his drawing shows the booth on the left outside on the sidewalk. We did a lot of research on this. Where it was, whether it was and we could not account for this phone booth. Laura said, that\u2019s because it never was. She said the only conceivable place for a phone at the Best Buy would have been inside in the foyer part of the store, but there was no phone there either. Laura says she knows this because she used to go to that Best Buy a lot, from the time it opened through \u201898 into \u201899, with her family and without her family.\nLaura Estrada Sandoval\nI used to steal CDs from there all the time, so I was pretty aware of what was around.\n\nSarah Koenig\nYou\u2019re saying you would shoplift CDs? Sorry, but--\n\nLaura Estrada Sandoval\nYeah. I don\u2019t have the CDs.\nSarah Koenig\nSo you\u2019re saying you would have noticed a thing like that because you were kind of aware.\n\nLaura Estrada Sandoval\nYeah because you\u2019re paying attention. You go in and are more aware of your surroundings than just walking into the store. At the time I remember looking up in the ceiling and seeing if there was any eyes in the sky, any cameras. There\u2019s a whole method, but you\u2019re very aware of who\u2019s entering and who was there at the entrance and when you\u2019re leaving, because you\u2019re fucking stealing and man, there\u2019s no phones there.\nSarah Koenig\nLaura and I hypothesised why, if there really wasn\u2019t a phone booth, how could the cops have missed a detail like that. Wouldn\u2019t they have noted it? Laura thought it wasn\u2019t a big deal to them.\nLaura Estrada Sandoval\nIt\u2019s such a small detail.\nSarah Koenig\nIt\u2019s not a small detail. It\u2019s not a small detail!\nLaura Estrada Sandoval\nWell, maybe to them.\n\nSarah Koenig\nNo it\u2019s not because they\u2019re saying that\u2019s where the 2:36 call comes from is that pay phone at Best Buy.\nLaura Estrada Sandoval\n(sighs) Yeah, I dunno why they wouldn\u2019t check it but there\u2019s no pay phone there man.\n\nSarah Koenig\nYou\u2019re sure?\n\nLaura Estrada Sandoval\nI\u2019m positive.\nSarah Koenig\nSo, that\u2019s thing one. Thing two I learned, it also relates to this 2:36 call. I talked to a woman named Summer. She went to Woodlawn, she\u2019s been listening to the podcast and she emailed me because when she heard this one part she said she started shaking her head. She said, if the State is saying Hae Lee was dead by 2:36--\nSummer\nIt\u2019s impossible. It\u2019s impossible. I mean, like, I mean it\u2019s just impossible. It\u2019s not, there\u2019s no way that she was at Best Buy at 2:36.\nSarah Koenig\nSummer was friends with Hae. Not close friends but they had a class together and they joked around and talked. Summer had a boyfriend who did sports at Woodlawn and she wanted an excuse to stay after school too so she could hang around with them. Hae told her there was an opening for another manager of the boys wrestling team, Hae was already doing that, so Summer joined her. The day Hae disappeared, the wrestling team had a match at Randallstown High School. Summer remembers talking to Hae after school in the gym area there, the wrestlers were milling around, Summer was preparing the equipment they had to load onto the bus and Hae came in to say \u201cI\u2019m not getting on the bus to the match, but I\u2019ll see you there.\u201d That wasn\u2019t welcome news to Summer, she needed Hae by her side at the match because Hae was more experienced at scoring which can be tricky in wrestling if you\u2019re new at it.\n\nSummer\nI was giving her hell because I\u2019m telling her \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d I needed her because we had to take points and things like that and she\u2019s like \u201cNo no no, I just have to go and you know, pick my little cousin up.\u201d\n\nSarah Koenig\nSummer says it wasn\u2019t a quick conversation either.\nSummer\nWe used to tease each other because she really was hilarious, so we would tease each other and go back and forth and we were at least talking for at least ten minutes.\nSarah Koenig\nYou\u2019re sure that this is the day because it\u2019s the day she didn\u2019t show up?\n\nSummer\nI\u2019m positive. I am positive. I\u2019m very positive. I looked for her the whole time at the away game. I was really pissed because I thought that she stood me up.\nSarah Koenig\nHae told Summer she would make her own way to Randallstown High for the match. No one but me probably remembers this now but Ines Butler-Hendrix who worked at the school said Hae had told her she was planning to catch the Randallstown bus. However, Ines initially told the cops the opposite, so I trust Summer\u2019s memory more and Summer is clear. Hae told her she was going to drive herself there.\nSummer said this conversation about Hae not getting on the bus happened after the last bell and also after the regular school buses had cleared the loop in front of the school. She said probably at around 2:30, 2:45. Summer says she has no dog in this fight, she\u2019s got no opinions on Adnan\u2019s guilt or innocence. She just knows what she knows.\nSummer\nAll of the things that I\u2019m unclear about or kinda shaky about, or-- I am clear on that. 2:36 would not have been possible for her to even have met him wherever because I know for a fact that she was probably with me during that time, or at the school during that time.\nSarah Koenig\nSummer never talked to the detectives, there\u2019s no mention of her in their notes, but she\u2019s not the only person who said they saw Hae after school that day. Becky saw her right after school, Debbie Warren said she talked to Hae too, the police notes say she saw her at approximately 3 p.m. inside the school near the gym which would match Summer\u2019s memory.\nSo, Laura says no phone booth at Best Buy. Summer says \u201cno way no how\u201d Hae was at Best Buy at 2:36. Combine that if you want with old information from Asia McClain who says she saw Adnan at around 2:30, 2:45 at the Woodlawn Public Library. Can we all agree that whatever happened to Hae probably didn\u2019t involve a 2:36 p.m. call from that phone booth saying \u201cCome and get me I\u2019m at Best Buy\u201d? I don\u2019t know about you but I\u2019m done considering that it\u2019s true, this 2:36 thing.\nIf you want to speculate with me here for a second, if we suspect that there wasn\u2019t a phone booth at Best Buy, that means the crime maybe didn\u2019t happen there. Jay\u2019s friend Chris said he heard the crime happened in the parking lot of the Woodlawn Public Library. But I gotta say, if you think the Best Buy is too public a place to commit a murder, you should see the library after school, swarming with kids. If the \u201cshe\u2019s dead, come and get me\u201d call wasn\u2019t at 2:36 maybe it\u2019s the next incoming call on the log, the 3:15 call. After all, no one actually testifies to the 2:36 timing at trial. This comes from the prosecutor\u2019s narrative alone. The problem is, if it is the 3:15 call, that really messes with Jay\u2019s testimony about where they were and what they were doing that afternoon.\nNow, third piece of new information. It\u2019s about what happened at Not-Her-Real-Name-Cathy\u2019s apartment that evening of January 13. Cathy remembered Adnan getting a call and reacting in an agitated way saying things like --\nCathy\nWhat am I gonna do? What am I gonna say? They\u2019re gonna come talk to me. What am I supposed to say?\nSarah Koenig\nCathy testified at trial about this call, how Adnan was acting panicked. I think it\u2019s possible that call Cathy overheard was not from a mystery third man or co-conspirator but from, wait for it, Hae\u2019s good friend Aisha Pittman.\nTo review for a sec. Hae\u2019s brother called the cops that afternoon. Officer Scott Adcock arrives from the Baltimore County PD. His initial report records the time as 5:12 p.m. Adcock calls Aisha and Adnan asking if they\u2019ve seen Hae. Here\u2019s what\u2019s new. I got an email recently from another friend in that Woodlawn Magnet group. Krista, saying she\u2019d talked to Aisha that evening of the 13th. \u201cIt was around 6 p.m. that night that I talked to Aisha and she was calling around to see if anyone had heard from her.\u201d Her meaning Hae.\nSo I checked with Aisha and she does remember speaking to Adnan. Here\u2019s what she wrote to me: \u201cI do remember speaking with Adnan that evening, but I thought he called me. From what I recall it was a super short conversation and he was annoyed that I\u2019d told the police to check in with him. I thought I spoke to him after the police called him.\u201d\nShe said it\u2019s possible her memory of who called whom could be mistaken, maybe she did call. There\u2019s definitely no outgoing call to Aisha on Adnan\u2019s cell that day. And maybe it was before he spoke to the cops not after, she can\u2019t be sure, but that\u2019s what she remembers. Again, you\u2019ve heard this information before but I\u2019m going to review it now. There are three calls on the call log around this time that all ping towers near Cathy\u2019s apartment. 6:07, 6:09 and 6:24. The first two calls are for a little less than a minute, the third call is the longest four minutes, fifteen seconds. That was likely Officer Adcock. So maybe Aisha called Adnan at 6:09, says \u201cI just talked to the police and they\u2019re going to get in touch with you too.\u201d Aisha says that Adnan was annoyed. Maybe that\u2019s what Cathy interpreted as panicked. I think we can all stipulate that Adnan was super stoned. He told me he had weed in the car and was worried the cops were going to find it if they came to talk to him. So, imagine for a second that Adnan is talking to Aisha and says something like--\n\nCathy\nWhat am I gonna do? What am I gonna say? They\u2019re gonna come talk to me. What am I supposed to say?\n\nSarah Koenig\nObviously I can\u2019t say for sure this is what happened, but if that strange call Cathy remembers was actually Aisha, then for me that rearranges all the pixels in Cathy\u2019s memory from suspicious to innocuous, if it\u2019s true.\nOK, now that we\u2019re caught up, let\u2019s go back to our regularly scheduled programme. This is from Adnan\u2019s second trial.\n\n\nCristina Gutierrez\nAre you prepared to make your election?\n\nAdnan Syed\nYes ma\u2019am.\n\nCristina Gutierrez\nAnd is your election to testify or to remain silent?\n\nAdnan Syed\nTo remain silent.\nCristina Gutierrez\nThank you. Do you have any questions about making that election?\n\nAdnan Syed\nNo ma\u2019am.\n\nSarah Koenig\nThat\u2019s Adnan not testifying. He told me he wanted to but his attorney advised against it. Not uncommon. It\u2019s a huge risk to open your client up to cross examination and impeachment. So, there he was. Mute through two trials, about five weeks total which is really hard for anyone.\n\nAdnan Syed\nIt was very-- I would say, probably the most stressful thing in my life. It\u2019s kind of cliched to say, going through a trial, but more so sitting there for so long, for so many days and weeks knowing that this jury is sitting there looking at me and ultimately they\u2019re going to be the ones to make the decision. I gotta sit up straight, it was like a trial within the trial in a sense. That was really struggle right there. There was sometimes where it was so unbelievable what was being said, I used to just look down. I would just literally be scribbling on a piece of paper, acting like I was taking notes. I just didn\u2019t know what else to do and it was going on for so long. It\u2019s just so frustrating because you want to keep interrupting and say \u201cHold on! But that\u2019s not true, that\u2019s not the reason why I got a phone! I didn\u2019t make that phone call. That\u2019s not me telling my parents I\u2019m going to somewhere but I\u2019m going to the club. That doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s indicative of my desire to commit murder or something,\u201d but it\u2019s just that you never get a chance to speak. You never get a chance to say anything. That\u2019s just the most frustrating thing in the world.\nSarah Koenig\nI wanna let Adnan talk now. Not so much about what happened the day of the crime, I feel like we\u2019ve been over that already, but just about what it was like to be him throughout this case. What it\u2019s like now to be locked up for so long. On the night of February 10, 1999, Aisha had broken the terrible news to to Krista about Hae\u2019s body being found. Krista then called Adnan who ran over to Aisha\u2019s, she lived very close to Adnan and then Krista joined them there, Stephanie came over too. They all sat there at Aisha\u2019s kitchen table crying.\nAdnan Syed\nYeah it was just a complete shock. No way did I, and I\u2019m pretty sure they didn\u2019t either, imagine that she would turn up, dead, murdered, her body would be found. So, no. I never ever considered that. I\u2019m pretty sure they didn\u2019t even think something bad happened, so we just kinda thought it was some, just some explanation. Hae was somewhere. With her father in California or with her new boyfriend, who knows? So, no.\nSarah Koenig\nLots of people told the cops and also told me that Adnan appeared to be in denial when they all first heard what had happened. They he\u2019d said things like \u201cIt\u2019s not her, they\u2019ve got the wrong person. All Asian women look alike.\u201d When Adnan got arrested Krista wrote down a chronology of everything she remembered from the previous six weeks. Here\u2019s what she wrote about that night at Aisha\u2019s.\n\nKrista\nWe went inside and Adnan was sitting at the kitchen table crying. After a while he said that there had to be a mistake and that Hae was still alive because her name was written in Aisha\u2019s agenda book. He wanted to call Detective O\u2019Shea but when he called the precinct he wasn\u2019t there. Adnan was upset so I took the phone and talked to the woman and explained that we wanted to just wanted to get some information and she said we would have to wait and call homicide in the morning.\nSarah Koenig\nWait wait wait. He-- Adnan called Detective O\u2019Shea?\nKrista\nMm-hm. The night that we found out that she had been murdered.\nSarah Koenig\nThat\u2019s right. Adnan called the Baltimore County Police Department to talk to Detective O\u2019Shea. To tell him they\u2019d misidentified this girl, whoever she was. That tidbit has always stayed with me. Is that something a distraught teenager would do? Or is that something a killer would do?\nAdnan Syed\nThe next day we went to school and it was definite, right? Everyone kept coming up to me, hugging me, it was just so much, so many people were like, \u201cAre you OK? Oh my god what happened?\u201d I\u2019m not doubting anyone\u2019s sincerity, it was just too much.\n\nSarah Koenig\nSo many people back then and now have talked about Adnan\u2019s reaction to Hae\u2019s death. That he was blank, or cried in heaving waves or not at all or that he seemed normal, or that he hid in the dark room in photography class or stared at a picture of him and Hae in psychology class. One teacher said he was tense and unresponsive when she gave him a hug. That a tick he had became more pronounced. Another said he was so sad that he was barely functioning. The school nurse testified at Adnan\u2019s first trial that she thought he faked a catatonic state. She wasn\u2019t allowed to testify in the second trial.\nNone of Adnan\u2019s friends saw anything strange in his behaviour. Besides, they said it was a strange time for everyone. It was terrifying and sad. They were all so young. How are you supposed to react?\nInterestingly, Jim Trainum, the former homicide detective we hired to review the investigation, immediately disregarded every single statement about Adnan\u2019s reaction. In terms of evaluating someone\u2019s guilt, he said, stuff like that is worthless. He advised me to do the same, just toss it all out he said, because it\u2019s subjective, it\u2019s hindsight, and also, people tend to bend their memories to what they think police think they want to hear.\nAdnan helped plan a memorial for Hae at school. They\u2019d plant a tree for her; it\u2019s still there in front of the school with a plaque. This time for Adnan is a blur, he says. Giant events kept coming, one after the other. He didn\u2019t have time to wrestle them into comprehension.\nAdnan Syed\nIt was kind of a struggle to keep doing everything normal. Life couldn\u2019t stop. It was just so many emotions, wondering how the heck could something like this happen to her. Then it was just a few weeks then I was arrested.\nSarah Koenig\nThe cops came to Adnan\u2019s house to speak to him on February 26, 1999, two days before they\u2019d arrest him. They hadn\u2019t interviewed Jenn or Jay yet. There\u2019s a report in their files about that meeting, which oddly is dated September 14, almost seven months after the fact. I don\u2019t know why. Detectives Ritz and MacGillivary come to Adnan\u2019s house and ask about Hae. \u201cWhen asked if Syed had a relationship with Hae Min Lee, Syed replied in a soft voice \u2018yes\u2019, however he didn\u2019t want his father to know.\u201d\nAdnan Syed\nThey sat there, they both of them sat at the couch. My father and I sat next to each other, they asked me a few questions and that\u2019s actually what I was worried about, was upsetting him. If you were to say \u201cwhat was the thing I was worried about the most?\u201d it would be upsetting him. There was no inkling in my mind that-- it was like I\u2019m worried about, he may as well say, the leak in the living room but there\u2019s an earthquake coming in the next two minutes, but I\u2019m worried about my father being upset about all of this and my mother as opposed to, I had no idea whatsoever that this murder charge was going to be coming.\n\nSarah Koenig\nEven after that conversation where your dad was there, you didn\u2019t think like \u201cuh oh\u201d?\nAdnan Syed\nNot at all. I understood they were asking questions but not that they actually thought that I killed Hae. I never, not one time, thought they actually believed that I killed Hae. I think any adult, anyone who has a sense of understanding could see the predicament that I was in and now the police are going to harass you because you\u2019re the ex-boyfriend. If it was me talking to seventeen year old Adnan, I\u2019d say \u201cHey Adnan, you\u2019re an idiot. You do know they are going to come after you now unless they find who did it because you\u2019re the most recent ex-boyfriend.\u201d So I can completely understand why you would ask me that but to be that person that had absolutely no ill will towards Hae, how anyone could, much less the police, could assume that I had something to do with it.\n\nSarah Koenig\nVery early in the morning on February 28, after they\u2019ve spoken to Jay, after Jay has shown them where Hae\u2019s car was parked off Edgewood Road, the detectives come into Adnan\u2019s bedroom and wake him up, tell him to put some clothes on , it\u2019s time to go. He dresses, sees his mother is watching, his older brother, his little brother Yusuf is crying. Then they drive Adnan into the city to an interrogation room in Homicide and hand cuff him to what he describes as a little hook in the wall.\n\nAdnan Syed\nThe one detective, his name was MacGillivary, he one thing that he stated was \u201chey man, I don\u2019t condone what you did but I have an ex-wife, or I just went through a divorce or something, I can understand how you can get mad.\u201d\n\nSarah Koenig\nThis, by the way, is what Jim Trainum calls \u201cOffering a Theme.\u201d You give the suspect an explanation, one that minimizes the crime as a starting point.\nAdnan Syed\nMacGillivary was being more so aggressive with me, like, \u201cwe know what you did\u201d, and Ritz was more so like-- at some point I think he said \u201cman, it would help out a lot if you would just tell us what you did.\u201d I said \u201cI was never mad at Hae, what are you guys talking about? I didn\u2019t do anything to her.\u201d He did mention that \u201cwell Adnan, we\u2019re gonna match your boots, we\u2019re gonna process your car--\u201d and at some point he did mention some red gloves. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna find the red gloves,\u201d or something.\n\nSarah Koenig\nAdnan says the detectives left the room for a while, then came back.\n\nAdnan Syed\n--and when they came back they had the Metro Crime Stopper. It was a picture like a reward paper. It was a picture of Hae and at some point they said \u201cwe\u2019ll leave you alone with this. You just look at Hae, you just look at this.\u201d So I\u2019m looking at it but I\u2019m still thinking this is a scare tactic, they\u2019re trying to scare me to see is there something that I know, what am I going to say, but still thinking that once this is over I\u2019m gonna leave. They both came in again and that\u2019s when they basically slid the paper to me and slid it on top of the Metro Crime Stopper Bulletin and that\u2019s where it said, it had the seal of Baltimore City in the top left hand corner and it said Charging Document or Statement of Charges and it said \u201cAdnan Syed did wilfully premeditated and with malice aforethought or deliberately murder or kill Hae Min Lee on such and such day\u201d and it said \u201cPunishable by First Degree Murder and in the State of Maryland it\u2019s punishable by the death penalty.\u201d So it said \u201cDeath Penalty\u201d and so that\u2019s when they said you\u2019re being charged with Hae Lee\u2019s murder.\n\nSarah Koenig\nAt this point Adnan asked for a lawyer. He says he was thinking of Matlock. He said the detectives stopped questioning him, they got ready to leave the room again. Keep in mind, Adnan was seventeen years old.\nAdnan Syed\nBefore they left I said \u201cwell what\u2019s going to happen now?\u201d because in my mind I\u2019m thinking I\u2019m not going home and I said to him, I don\u2019t remember if I thought it or I said it, what\u2019s in my mind is \u201cI still gotta finish this report.\u201d You know I have to give this report on Monday.\n\n\nSarah Koenig\nHe had an annotated bibliography due in his English class he said. Bill Ritz tried to make Adnan\u2019s situation plain to him.\n\nAdnan Syed\nThe last thing I can remember him saying is \u201cAdnan, you\u2019re not going home.\u201d\n\nSarah Koenig\nAnd did you get it?\n\nAdnan Syed\nI\u2019m not sure.\n\nSarah Koenig\nYou didn\u2019t think he meant you\u2019re never going home.\n\nAdnan Syed\nIt\u2019s probably it\u2019s impossible for you or anyone else who hasn\u2019t been through this to understand. To be a seventeen-year-old kid in this situation with no experience with the system, no experience with any of this stuff, it\u2019s very difficult to believe in the early stages that this is actually what\u2019s happening. This must be just some huge mistake. No, there\u2019s just no way, there was no way in my mind that this was going to continue.\nSarah Koenig\nOften when Adnan tells stories about this time, he zeros in on some small moment when someone was kind to him.\nAdnan Syed\nThere was someone in plain clothes, he stuck his head in the door and he said \u201chey man, just have faith.\u201d To me it came across as an encouragement, he wasn\u2019t saying it to taunt me or anything. To me it came across as being something like encouragement or some advisement.\nSarah Koenig\nThat\u2019s it, that\u2019s the whole story. But he\u2019s mentioned this guy to me multiple times. Also, the white lady who was driving the cruiser that took him downtown. She was polite. There was the sheriff\u2019s deputy who looked like Judd Hirsch who slipped him a candy bar. The eighth grade teacher whose name he can\u2019t remember who wrote him that nice letter. I can imagine how you\u2019d seize these kindnesses and that they\u2019d nestle into your brain forever.\n\nKrista\nNow, these I obviously need to hold onto, but this is our Junior Prom pictures.\n\nSarah Koenig\nLast spring Dana and I went to Krista\u2019s house. Krista was good friends with Hae and Adnan, she was Krista Myers back then. She\u2019d dug out a trove of photos and yearbook stuff and letters. Krista and Adnan wrote to each other during his first year in jail, through his trial. She visited him frequently when he was in prison in Jessup, Maryland, much closer than where he is now in Cumberland. Krista is clear eyed, organised and thoughtful. Hae\u2019s death was the defining event of her youth. It messed with her, as did Adnan\u2019s arrest and conviction. She\u2019s not in the Rabia camp of 100 per cent there\u2019s no way in the world Adnan did this. She\u2019s more \u201cIf he did it then I don\u2019t understand human beings because the guy I knew\u2026\u201d et cetera.\n\nKrista\nSo it\u2019s just he\u2019s a normal, kind person. Do you know what I mean? These aren\u2019t letters from somebody that\u2019s malicious or just trying to sway you to believe him, it\u2019s somebody that\u2019s genuinely, in my opinion, cares about people, trying to make the best of a bad situation.\nSarah Koenig\nHere\u2019s the guy she knew. June 2,1999.  \u201cDid you get that really expensive prom dress you wanted and who\u2019d you go with if you don\u2019t mind me asking. :)\u201d He asks how things are going with Andy, they\u2019d been having problems. He tells her stories about jail.\nJune 8. \u201cYou should send me some pictures. We\u2019re allowed to get them. Man, some guys in here get some really dirty pictures. I mean dirty. Let me put it to you like this - I\u2019ve seen more than I\u2019d wanted to of a lot of people\u2019s wives or girlfriends to last a lifetime. While most guys are really protective of their pictures, someone\u2019s always pulling me aside to show me their latest flick. It\u2019s really kinda disgusting.\u201d He mentioned he\u2019s gotten letters from other kids from school. Laura, Ja\u2019uan, Justin, Asia, Aaron. That\u2019s all he says about Asia by the way, he doesn\u2019t seem to attach any importance to her letters or note that she\u2019s a potential alibi. Maybe because he doesn\u2019t know the State\u2019s timeline for the murder yet.\nAdnan was in with the juvenile population when he was first arrested in February. In May he turned eighteen and then moved over to be with the adults. I\u2019d assume that would be awful in myriad ways, but Adnan writes this to Krista:\n\u201cIt\u2019s weird. When I first came here I didn\u2019t know what the heck was going on. Let me tell you it was pretty bad. But I don\u2019t mean physically like no one was trying to beat me up or anything. People didn\u2019t know what to think of me. I mean, first of all, everyone in here is black and always threatening to beat the hell out of someone else. And then you have me, light skinned and quiet. I didn\u2019t say much to anyone, no one said much to me. Four months later, I can be anywhere in the entire jail, it\u2019s huge, and someone will call \u201cSyed!\u201d People say \u201cwhat\u2019s up?\u201d to me, ask how things are and I don\u2019t even know them. The strange thing is, so many people come to me saying \u201cif anyone bothers you, let me know\u201d that there\u2019s no one left to bother me. Some of it is due to the fact that I\u2019m a Muslim and a lot is due to my personality. You know I\u2019ve been blessed in that I can make friends almost anywhere I go. Now I can really say anywhere.\u201d He tells her he\u2019s gotten elected to Inmate Council.\nYou can see how Adnan initially thinks this is all temporary. \u201cI\u2019ll be out by graduation, maybe by summer, maybe by whenever.\u201d It fades a little more the closer he gets to trial. Krista would testify for the State at trial. She\u2019s the one who talked about hearing him ask Hae for a ride that afternoon, which Adnan said he didn\u2019t do. But he doesn\u2019t hold it against her. He\u2019s so sweet to Krista in these letters, asks about the dental work she got done, how her little sister\u2019s doing, how her mother\u2019s doing, whether her car got fixed. He talks about his feelings. They discuss religion and God, their problems. Krista\u2019s parents were divorcing. They\u2019re intimate friends who trust each other. The most striking letters to me are the ones he wrote immediately before and after his sentencing. He didn\u2019t end up facing the death penalty by the way. The first one, he writes it while he\u2019s in what\u2019s called the bullpen, waiting to be sentenced. It\u2019s got a cutout from a magazine stapled to it of an Asian young woman, smiling.\nWhat\u2019s this Krista?\n\nKrista\nThat\u2019s actually not Hae.\n\nSarah Koenig\nOh it looks like her!\nKrista\nSo, he found this in a magazine and said that it-- this girl looks-- he found this in a magazine and it looked so much like Hae--\n\nSarah Koenig\nDoes it look like her to you?\n\nKrista\nYes. Yeah.\nSarah Koenig\n\u201cYou know what\u2019s really weird? I was looking through this Jet magazine, in case you didn\u2019t know it features African-American issues. :)\u201d He tells Krista that Hae had been appearing in his dreams, that dreams like this have a certain significance in Islam. But anyway, he was looking through this Jet magazine and he does a double take because the girl looks so much like Hae. Even her watch looks like Hae\u2019s watch. \u201cTake a look at it and tell me what you think. I hope I\u2019m not going crazy.\u201d I found this perplexing. He seems relaxed in the letter. This is a kid who is about to be sentenced to life in prison. He knows that\u2019s what\u2019s about to happen. It\u2019s the mandatory sentence for his conviction. That conviction, of course was for killing Hae, Krista\u2019s good friend. In this pregnant, life changing moment, he\u2019s writing a letter to Krista, about whether this photo he saw while flipping through a magazine looks like Hae. Is it too nonchalant or something? Is it creepy? Adnan explains several things about this. First, he wasn\u2019t especially nervous right then. That was about to change, but at that point he says that he was thinking of his sentencing as a procedure he needed to get through so he could immediately start the appeals process. So in a way it was a step toward the thing he wanted. Second, it\u2019s not like they transport you from your cell right to the courtroom door, and you\u2019re just outside straightening your tie before your big moment. It\u2019s kind of the opposite. There is an enormous quotient of utter boredom and exhaustion built in. So you do other things. Read, write letters. Whatever you can.\n\nAdnan Syed\nIt would be hard to understand, you spend hours sitting in bullpens waiting. If you get up at three o\u2019clock in the morning, then you go downstairs in the basement of the jail, you\u2019re just sitting in a bullpen. It\u2019s basically just a square room, a concrete bench built into the wall that goes around. There\u2019s probably anywhere from fifty to a hundred people so everyone\u2019s just sitting there. You might sit there for four hours, then you go to the court. Then you sit for like another four or five hours, until you go to court at maybe ten or eleven o\u2019clock in the morning. So after doing this for so long, it just numbs the mind, so-- I know people who have taken plea deals just to not have to go to court anymore.\n\nSarah Koenig\nReally?\nAdnan Syed\nYou know what I mean? No, honestly, not even exaggerating.\n\nSarah Koenig\nThe third thing is that Krista was the only person he was in regular touch with who knew Hae. And Krista didn\u2019t think that Adnan had killed her.\n\n\n\n\nAdnan Syed\n--so I could talk to her about Hae, it\u2019s not going to be-- She accepts me. She accepted me and I could talk to her about anything or write to her about anything, so a lot of times that\u2019s what it would be.\n\nSarah Koenig\nEight days later, post sentencing, he writes Krista another letter and he\u2019s so changed. By this time, he\u2019d fired Christina Gutierrez over the Asia letters and he\u2019s being represented by a public defender he doesn\u2019t really know. Adnan tells the guy he wants to tell the court he did not kill Hae and that he is going to continue to fight this until the end. That\u2019s what he says in his letter to Krista, and the guy says \u2018no, no, no, terrible idea. Don\u2019t say you\u2019re innocent, it will anger the judge.\u201d Adnan argues with him, and according to Adnan the lawyer says, \u201cwell you can do it if you want but you\u2019re just going to fuck yourself over.\u201d\nSo, now Adnan is worried and then another thing that he hadn\u2019t anticipated, that Hae\u2019s mother was going to speak. She\u2019d been to the trial every day I think. Sometimes I glimpsed her in the videos, keeping perfectly still, or doubled over, or holding onto someone. There\u2019s more than one bench conference during the trial in which they talk about the mother\u2019s crying being a possible distraction to the jury.\nHer pain throughout must have been abject. On this day, through a translator, Hae\u2019s mother speaks. She tells the court about her daughter. She tells the court about a Korean proverb that says, when parents die, they\u2019re buried in the ground, but when a child dies, you bury the child in your heart. \u201cWhen I die, when I die my daughter will die with me. As long as I live, my daughter is buried in my heart. I don\u2019t know where to hear her voice, I don\u2019t know where to touch her hand. I would like to forgive Adnan Syed but as of now, I just don\u2019t know how to do that and I just cannot do that right now.\u201d\nFor many, many months we tried to contact Hae\u2019s family, to tell them we were doing this story, and in hopes that they might want to talk to us about Hae . In my twenty plus years of reporting, I have never tried harder to find anyone. Letters, in English and in Korean, phone calls, social media, friends of friends of friends, two private detectives, Korean-speaking researchers, people knocking on doors in three different states, calls to South Korea. We never heard back from them. I learned a few days ago that they know what we\u2019re doing; my best guess is that they want no part of it, which I respect.\nAbout Hae, I can tell you only what I have heard from non-family members. That she was cheerful and light and funny. That she loved the movie Titanic, that she sometimes put nail polish on just so that she could pick it off. She wasn\u2019t insecure, seemingly ever. Sprite was her favorite soda. The Dallas Cowboys her favorite team, not because she cared about football but because she liked the colors blue and silver. That she could charm you without trying. That she was a good friend to her friends. She took in their problems and their pain and tried to help them if she could.\nAt the sentencing, listening to Hae\u2019s mother, that was the first time Adnan understood how people on Hae\u2019s side of the courtroom saw him. He\u2019d never felt hated before. In his June 14, 2000 letter to Krista he writes, \u201con the one hand I feel her pain because I cared about Hae and how sad she is, but on the other, I\u2019m thinking \u2018please believe me I didn\u2019t kill your daughter.\u2019 She was sitting right next to me and it was really sad but I couldn\u2019t help thinking that my mom is going through the exact same thing. She\u2019s going to lose her son forever. Afterwards I was thinking, my god, no one believes in me. Krista, I could never explain how that felt.\u201d\nAdnan\u2019s attorney then addresses the court. \u201cYour honor, I would ask that this honorable court, if it would consider this case more a crime of passion than of intent to kill.\u201d From Adnan\u2019s letter, \u201cthat\u2019s all I heard him say, and I turned and just stared at him, wanting to hit him with a chair or something. I mean, this jerk is going to get up and give away the only thing I have, my innocence.\u201d\nWhen it\u2019s Adnan\u2019s turn to speak, he suddenly realizes he has no idea what to say. He\u2019s had his plan but, now, \u201con the other hand, I\u2019d been thinking about what the lawyer said, about the judge getting upset. On the third hand, I\u2019m thinking, man, I should just apologize for everything even though I didn\u2019t kill Hae. Stupid me, I end up doing a little of each.\u201d It\u2019s true, when his moment comes he maintains his innocence, he asks for the mercy of the court and he says, \u201cI\u2019m just sorry for all the pain that this has caused everyone.\u201d\nThe judge, Wanda Heard, disagreed with Adnan\u2019s attorney at sentencing. We know this because she said, \u201cI disagree with you, Council. This wasn\u2019t a crime of passion.\u201d She said to Adnan, you planned it, \u201cyou used that intellect, you used that physical strength, you used that charismatic ability of yours that made you the president or the- what was it?- the king or the prince of your prom? You used that to manipulate people and even today, I think you continue to manipulate even those that love you, as you did to the victim. You manipulated her to go with you to her death.\u201d\nOnce, early on, I asked Adnan, \u201cIf you\u2019re saying you\u2019re innocent, why aren\u2019t you bitter and angry, why do you sound so calm?\u201d And he said a lot of things, then and since, because there\u2019s no one answer. Part of it he says is that he realizes how lucky he is, compared to so many other guys inside. His family visits, he calls them all the time, they send him money. He\u2019s got people like Rabia and Saad pulling for him. \u201cI refuse to be miserable,\u201d he said to me. Being religious helps, which you hear about people all the time in prison, but I never thought about it too much before I got to know Adnan. When he ended up in prison, he says that he made a choice, to be a better Muslim. Now he can say that for nearly half his life, he\u2019s lived like he\u2019s supposed to. He knows it\u2019s a rationalization of his situation but it\u2019s been the most helpful one. Finally, he says he\u2019s got a clear conscience, because he didn\u2019t kill Hae, though once he did say to me, \u201cI\u2019m here because of my own stupid actions.\u201d I asked him what he meant.\n\nAdnan Syed\nAt the end of the day, who can I-- I never should have let someone hold my car. I never should have let someone hold my phone. I never should have been friends with these people who-- who else can I blame but myself?\nSarah Koenig\nWell you can blame Jay if you think he\u2019s lying.\n\nAdnan Syed\nYeah, but him, the police, the prosecutors-- sure what happened to me happened to me, I had nothing to do with this right? But at the end of the day, I have to take some responsibility. You don\u2019t really know the things that my younger brother went through. What my family goes through. At the end of the day, if I had been just a good Muslim, somebody that didn\u2019t do any of these things. (pause) It\u2019s something that weighs heavily on me. I mean, no way, I had absolutely nothing to do with Hae\u2019s murder but at the end of the day-- I can\u2019t-- yeah.\n\n(pause)\n\nSarah Koenig\nA prosecutor I was talking to said \u201cof course Adnan can\u2019t ever admit to this crime. After all his parents have been through. The fear, the money, the anguish. How could he ever turn around and say to them \u2018I did it.\u2019?\u201d Adnan took issue with that.\nAdnan Syed\nThe two most important people to me in the world are my mother and father. I know the thing that bothers them the most is not necessarily me being in prison, but is the injustice. You can accept bad things happening when they\u2019re earned. The irony of this is that my father and mother will probably sleep better at night if I had truly done this and I told them the reason why I\u2019m in prison is because I\u2019ve done this. \u201cHe\u2019s there because he deserves to be there. We still love him, we still are going to take care of him, we still are going to make-- he\u2019s our son. At least we\u2019re gonna have that feeling that he\u2019s somewhere where he doesn\u2019t deserve to be.\u201d They don\u2019t necessarily worry about me being in prison because they come to see me and they see that I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m fine, I\u2019m healthy, whenever they come visit me I\u2019m in good spirits and everything like that. For the prosecutor to say that the reason why I can\u2019t look these people in their face is that-- the contradiction in that is that it would actually be easier for them to deal with me being in prison if they knew that I deserved to be here.\nSarah Koenig\nI can\u2019t say what would truly be easier for his family. Knowing their son had murdered someone or feeling as if he\u2019d been taken from them unjustly. But it is true that Adnan has always been fine in prison. He\u2019s adaptable. He pointed out to me that he\u2019d never been independent anyway. First, a ward of his parents, then a ward of the state.\nHe spent the initial part of his sentence at a prison in Jessup, about a thirty minute drive for his family. It was a looser place than where he is now, at North Branch, in Cumberland. A maximum security prison more than two hours away from Baltimore.\n\nAdnan Syed\nThe prisons that I\u2019ve been in they\u2019ve been, they\u2019re fairly corrupt places, so they are not really strict, in a sense where it\u2019s like \u201cyou\u2019ve got to do this at that time or you\u2019ve got to do this at that time.\u201d Maybe corrupt isn\u2019t the right word, but maybe it actually is.\n\nSarah Koenig\nIn Jessup, especially, people got away with all kinds of craziness. That prison is closed now. Adnan\u2019s had only had one infraction his entire time. Which, a guy at the DOC told me, was impressive for anyone. After I asked about his prison record, Adnan sent me a stack of copies, 21 different certificates and awards for completing this program or helping with that activity. In 2005, he got one called the \u201cDistinguished Gentleman\u2019s Award for your consistent display of character, mannerism, self-control, and ability to manage adversity,\u201d signed by the warden.\nAdnan\u2019s one infraction was for having a cell phone, which he had for five years. Actually, he had a couple of different cell phones. A new one he got, he couldn\u2019t figure out how to make it work--\n\nAdnan Syed\nSo, mind you I still had my first phone, so I called customer service. And, I\u2019m talking to this T-Mobile lady and she\u2019s walking me through the phone she\u2019s like oh it doesn\u2019t work, just take it to your T-Mobile store. I\u2019m like, well I can\u2019t-- the situation isn\u2019t really conducive for me to go to the T-Mobile store right? But she\u2019s like oh no, just take it! I\u2019m like thanks a lot. She\u2019s like, alright, bye sweetie. This old lady. I\u2019m like \u201calright, cool.\u201d\n\nSarah Koenig\nAt Jessup, Adnan had a good job. He was a clerk in the Chaplain's Office which gave him access to a computer, and to a printer and copier. Being an entrepreneurial sort he ran a couple of side businesses, printing stuff and making copies for people. At North Branch, he\u2019s a cook. He told me the only jobs at North Branch are either kitchen or custodial jobs. He\u2019s got a group of friends he\u2019s close with, guys who came into the system the same time he did. They have a little breakfast club that he\u2019s in charge of, another guy does lunch. Membership has it\u2019s privileges.\n\nAdnan Syed\nToday, I made these omelettes with caramelized apples in them, and onions. They were really good, and cheese on the inside. And then I made some, uh--\n\nSarah Koenig\nBanana french toast also, also hot cereal with peaches and raisins. For lunch, cheese steaks. The other 1500 guys they cook for, got the normal menu: boiled eggs and boloney. Adnan lives in a cell by himself, he\u2019s got TV. If he\u2019s getting in fights or seeing horrible things, he\u2019s not telling me about it. All the stuff he tells me about is, at worst, PG-13. He told me, \u201cI have a life, it\u2019s not the life I planned, or imagined, but, I have a life.\u201d\nDespite the Nisha Call, despite the Leakin Park cell tower evidence, despite Jay knowing where Hae\u2019s car was, I confess to having reasonable doubt about whether Adnan killed Hae. I\u2019m not talking about the courtroom kind, I\u2019m talking about the normal person kind. Obviously, a trial isn\u2019t built to hold the stories Adnan, or anyone, tells about his life. So his lawyer, Christina Gutierrez, had to figure out another way to encourage reasonable doubt. Why didn\u2019t it work?\nNext time, on Serial. Which will not come out next week.
