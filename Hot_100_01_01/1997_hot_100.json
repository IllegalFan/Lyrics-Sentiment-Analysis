            "artist": "Toni Braxton",
            "lyrics": "Often when discussing the elite pack of divas who ruled the '90s and early aughts, Toni Braxton is cast aside.\n\nThis shouldn\u2019t be the case \u2014 there\u2019s way more to her story than \u201dUn-Break My Heart.\u201d\n\nKnown for her sultry, low-ranging contralto voice, Braxton -- who turns 50 this Saturday, Oct. 7 -- provided the R&B, pop, and adult contemporary hemispheres with a slew of signature classics.\n\nThe dramatic flare of these songs, matched with her film noir aesthetic and style, convincingly sold Braxton\u2019s extensive discography centered on the raging emotions of love and heartbreak. The smoothness and mature sophistication in her sound offered a lighter (and calmer) shading to the early waves of hip-hop soul and alternative-R&B that reigned supreme in the '90s.\n\nWell into the early aughts, Braxton would find herself pairing quiet storm vibes with hip-hop undertones.\n\nAfter an unfortunate dip in mainstream appeal maligned by label issues and personal matters in the mid-00\u2019s (although that period would bring notable deep cuts and plenty more \u201cwhat could have beens\u201d), Braxton regained her place in the spotlight with a Dancing With The Stars stint, a successful reality TV show alongside her sisters, and a critically-acclaimed reunion album with her mentor Kenneth \u201cBabyface\u201d Edmonds.\n\nNow the legend prepares to release her ninth studio album, slated to be released next year, including her current single \u201cDeadwood.\u201d\n\nTo celebrate the songstress' milestone birthday, Billboard ranks the 25 best Toni Braxton songs, including singles and deep cuts.\n\n#25. \"You Mean The World To Me\" (1993)\n\nAfter departing from her all-sisters quintet, The Braxtons, the eldest of the girl group embarked on a successful solo career.\n\n1993 saw the arrival of Toni Braxton, a self-titled debut that topped both the Billboard 200 and R&B Albums charts for multiple weeks. As the fourth lead single on the LP, \u201cYou Mean The World\u201d reached the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 in 1994, thanks to the soulful swing of the hook dedicated to a cherished lover.\n\n#24. \"Why Should I Care\" (1996)\n\nFollowing up her debut with Secrets, Braxton reinvigorated the sound and format of quiet storm with arguably her best album to date.\nFull of ballads centered on dealing with an unfaithful soulmate, Secrets cemented the legacy of Braxton\u2019s signature blend of mature-R&B with breezy adult contemporary. In this deep cut, the crooner questions why she should care about said partner over a psychedelic guitar riff and synth reminiscent of The Isley Brothers.\n\n#23. \"Spanish Guitar\" (2000)\n\nMost legends can\u2019t say that their international single became a soundtrack staple for a Brazilian soap opera. La\u00e7os de Fam\u00edlia would help Braxton\u2019s Latin pop ballad become a mass success in its home country -- and ultimately a primary example of Latin music\u2019s influence on mainstream culture.\n\n#22. \"The Heat\" (2000)\n\n\u201cSpanish Guitar\u201d aptly oozed a sweltering mystique fitting enough for Braxton\u2019s third studio album, The Heat. Also incorporating that magic is the album\u2019s title track, a subtle jaunt working in the sounds of a tropical summer and a light, jazzy groove. No wonder why the ending question is \u201cdoes anyone want some ice cream?\u201d\n\n#21. \"Hit The Freeway\" feat. Loon (2002)\n\nEntering the new millennium, Braxton gained more artistic control from LaFace. She also felt a need to strip away some of her balladry and embrace her love of hip-hop \u00e1 la Mariah Carey\u2019s Butterfly. Braxton\u2019s first LPs of the aughts -- The Heat and More Than A Woman -- also embraced a sexier, borderline controversial side of the songstress.\n\nAs the lone single from More Than A Woman, \u201cFreeway\u201d joins a list of notable bangers produced by Pharrell\u2019s launching pad, The Neptunes. And thanks to its Loon co-sign, it also has a Bad Boys Records stamp of approval.\n\n#20. \"Trippin' (That's The Way Love Works)\" (2005)\n\nAfter leaving LaFace Records in 2003, Braxton signed to the record label abyss known as Blackground Records. If you're familiar with the label\u2019s nightmare stories revolving around Aaliyah and JoJo, it goes without saying that Braxton\u2019s first (and only) album under the label, Libra, didn\u2019t fare well commercially.\n\nThat being said, the LP contains the singer\u2019s peak unreleased singles and barely-existent promos. The highlight of this particular cut: A comparison of spousal conflict with \u201c12 rounds up inside the [Madison Square] Garden.\u201d\n\n#19. \"Talking In His Sleep\" (1996)\n\n\u201cCan you keep a secret?\u201d asks the diva throughout the epicenter track of Secrets. Here, she\u2019s confronted by her adulterous lover who accidentally spills his dirty laundry while snoozing.\nAfflicted by a 70s noir-jazz riff, \u201cTalking\u201d takes a page from Madonna\u2019s \u201cJustify My Love,\u201d balancing a scandalous spoken word narrative with a seductive hook.\n\n#18. \"Yesterday\" feat. Trey Songz (2009)\n\nIt\u2019d take five years after Libra -- and a release from Blackground Records -- for Braxton to deliver her next studio album. Serving as the first single from Pulse, the singer gets over her ex (played by Trey Songz on deluxe versions) by labeling him a day of the past. \u201cYesterday\u201d served as a testament to how Braxton manages to maintain her signature blend of genre formats years after her higher charting moments.\n\n#17. \"Hurt You\" feat. Babyface (2014)\n\nWhen Braxton started her singing career in 1989, Babyface became an integral component of her artistry. After going through separate divorces, the duo partnered up for the Grammy-winning concept album Love, Marriage, and Divorce, featuring this apology ballad that topped the Adult R&B Songs chart.\n\n#16. \"Midnite\" (2005)\n\nThis cut from Libra perfectly captures Braxton\u2019s ability to cruise along with the stripped melodic structuring of her songs. Her ad-libs and riffs shine throughout \u201cMidnite,\u201d making it a pleasant earworm in her deeper catalogue.\n\n#15. \"Love Shoulda Brought You Home\" (1992)\n\nAlthough \u201cGive U My Heart\u201d -- a duet with Babyface -- is credited as Braxton\u2019s official single debut, \u201cLove\u201d receives the honor of her first solo effort. Both songs appeared on the Eddie Murphy rom-com Boomerang, but \u201cLove\u201d would be regarded as the favorite thanks to Braxton\u2019s powerhouse vocal control and dexterity.\n\n#14. \"How Many Ways\" (1993)\n\nReleased as a single in 1994, \u201cHow Many Ways\u201d adequately reflects the finalization of new jack swing and the emerging popularity of its brethren, hip-hop soul.\n\nThe soulful declaration -- co-written and produced by Tamar\u2019s future husband Vincent Hubert -- sees Braxton recounting various ways she loves her man. The single served opposite to its double-A side, the Whitney Houston-esque \u201cI Belong To You.\u201d\n\n#13. \u201cSeven Whole Days\u201d (1993)\nRegarded as one of Braxton\u2019s iconic singles, the songstress recalls not knowing her lover\u2019s whereabouts for more than a week.\n\nWritten and produced by her dream team of Babyface and Darryl Simmons, Braxton\u2019s runs are what impressed listeners the most. She would later revisit the song\u2019s idea, slyly mentioning \u201cgoing seven whole days without hearing from you,\u201d on \u201cFinally,\u201d Libra's semi-mash-up of her most famous lyrics.\n\n#12. \u201cJust Be A Man About It\u201d (2000)\n\nSince The Heat was meant to embrace the more progressive sounds of contemporary R&B, Braxton also incorporated a little electro-hop on the album\u2019s second single.\n\nWith the support of a stormy atmosphere and womanizing voicemail delivered by Dr. Dre, the singer\u2019s hurt vocals shine in yet another convincing performance.\n\n#11. \u201cThere\u2019s No Me Without You\u201d (1996)\n\nThis deep cut earnestly emotes despair and a feeling of defeat after a break-up.\n\nHelped by backing vocals of the songwriter, Babyface, this Toni Braxton song\u2019s hook glides with a country twang --  the singer adopting the vocal patterns of the genre with a pristine R&B palette.\n\n#10. \"Take This Ring\" (2005)\n\nImma let you finish Beyonc\u00e9, but Toni Braxton had one of the best \u201cSingle Ladies\u201d of all time.\n\nThree years before we\u2019d receive an official dance and a Spandex-driven anthem from Bey, Braxton released a club banger echoing a similar sentiment. Fortified by a rocking go-go beat -- produced by \u201cCrazy In Love\u201d and \u201c1 Thing\u201d hitmaker Rich Harrison -- this dose of playboy-repellent serves as a faint reminder of a music moment somewhat ahead of its time.\n\n#9. \"Sposed To Be\" (2005)\n\nOn Libra, \u201cTake This Ring\u201d was the upbeat single deserving more; \u201cSposed To Be\u201d was the slow jam that could have been more.\n\nA great candidate for quiet storm or lovemaking playlists, this deep cut radiates an intergalactic tranquility -- and infectious bridge -- highlighting the finesse of Braxton\u2019s later discography.\n\n#8. \"Hands Tied\" (2010)\n\nThe second single of Pulse came as another one of Braxton\u2019s sultrier career moments.\n\nWith an urgent vocal performance, the allure of \u201cHands Tied\u201d exists in its zephyrous keyboard chords. The song also provided a glimpse into the softer side of Warren \u201cOak\u201d Felder, who\u2019d go on to produce for Rihanna and Demi Lovato.\n\n#7. \"Another Sad Love Song\" (1993)\n\nFrom its opening \u201coh\u2019s\u201d and \u201cwoah\u2019s\u201d over a slinky melody, the first official single from Toni Braxton played on R&B\u2019s knack for providing radio with sad tunes.\n\nWith an addictive hook \u201cracking [people\u2019s] brains like crazy,\u201d the song reached No. 7 on the Hot 100 and earned a Grammy for \u201cBest R&B Vocal Performance, Female.\u201d\n\n#6. \"I Love Me Some Him\" (1996)\n\nIf R&B radio is unanimously consistent with playing one Toni Braxton single since its release, \u201cI Love Me Some Him\u201d would hold that title for sure.\n\nRegarded as one of her signatures, the song was released as a double-A side single to the R. Kelly-penned \u201cI Don\u2019t Want To.\u201d The best part exists at the end of this cosmopolitan ode -- Braxton\u2019s vocal harmonizing with the instrumental stealing the show.\n\n#5. \"Find Me A Man\" (1996)\n\nToday, Secrets remains without a skippable track. It also contains the singer\u2019s best deep cut.\n\nIn terms of essential Toni Braxton, \u201cFind Me A Man\u201d shows the singer\u2019s ability to draw listeners into her raw emotion over a cerebral melody. Here heartbreak reigns as the songstress finds herself tired of being alone, dreaming up the irresistible qualities of her Prince Charming.\n\n#4. \"Un-Break My Heart\" (1996)\n\nStanding as one of the greatest power ballads to ever exist, this Hot 100 chart-topper is the central song of Braxton\u2019s career. Vibrant in grandiose-theatrics and a heart-wrenching chorus in the midst of vocal acrobatics, \u201cUn-Break My Heart\u201d would sit at the summit for 11 weeks.\n\n#3. \"Breathe Again\" (1993)\n\nAs these Toni Braxton songs age, this single from her debut still finds its way on R&B rotation today. Sparkling in Sade-centric balladry and Diane Warren lyrics, the breathy chorus and stagnant verses displayed by Braxton execute the song\u2019s intended moodiness.\n\n\u201cBreathe Again\u201d would become a No. 3 hit and earn the singer\u2019s second Grammy win for Best R&B Vocal Performance, Female.\n\n#2. \"He Wasn\u2019t Man Enough For Me\" (2000)\n\nThe new millennium might have seen a new look and sound from the diva, but her anthemic spirit remained fervent. In the league of \u201cNo Scrubs\u201d and \u201cIndependent Women, Pt. 1,\u201d this song holds its own rightful spot.\n\nProduced by Rodney \u201cDarkchild\u201d Jerkins, this signature dance bop was blocked from the Hot 100\u2019s top spot by the stronghold of Carlos Santana and The Product G&B\u2019s \u201cMaria Maria.\u201d Today, it\u2019s revisited by those realizing a past flame couldn\u2019t handle it all.\n\n#1. \"Let It Flow\" (1996)\n\nPaired alongside \u201cYou\u2019re Makin\u2019 Me High,\u201d this double A-side single peaked at No. 1 on the Hot 100. Unlike its partnered uptempo jaunt, \u201cLet It Flow\u201d drifts like a slow-running stream guided by the presence of a hypnotizing guitar.\n\nStaying in line with the anthems Braxton has provided prior to and after \u201cLet It Flow,\u201d the song became a mainstay on radio, the Waiting To Exhale Soundtrack, and most importantly Braxton\u2019s performance catalogue.\n\nSimply put, \u201cLet It Flow\u201d could have been done by none other than the superstar herself -- particularly the mesmerizing ending.Embed",

            "lyrics": "A Meeting\n\nVIRGINSKY LIVED IN HIS OWN house, or rather his wife's, in Muravyin Street. It was a wooden house of one story, and there were no lodgers in it. On the pretext of Virginsky's-name-day party, about fifteen guests were assembled; but the entertainment was not in the least like an ordinary provincial name-day party. From the very beginning of their married life the husband and wife had agreed once for all that it was utterly stupid to invite friends to celebrate name-days, and that \"there is nothing to rejoice about in fact.\" In a few years they had succeeded in completely cutting themselves off from all society. Though he was a man of some ability, and by no means very poor, he somehow seemed to every one an eccentric fellow who was fond of solitude, and, what's more, \"stuck up in conversation.\" Madame Virginsky was a midwife by profession\u2014and by that very fact was on the lowest rung of the social ladder, lower even than the priest's wife in spite of her husband's rank as an officer. But she was conspicuously lacking in the humility befitting her position. And after her very stupid and unpardonably open liaison on principle with Captain Lebyadkin, a notorious rogue, even the most indulgent of our ladies turned away from her with marked contempt. But Madame Virginsky accepted all this as though it were what she wanted. It is remarkable that those very ladies applied to Arina Prohorovna (that is, Madame Virginsky) when they were in an interesting condition, rather than to any one of the other three accoucheuses of the town. She was sent for even by country families living in the neighbourhood, so great was the belief in her knowledge, luck, and skill in critical cases. It ended in her practising only among the wealthiest ladies; she was greedy of money. Feeling her power to the full, she ended by not putting herself out for anyone. Possibly on purpose, indeed, in her practice in the best houses she used to scare nervous patients by the most incredible and nihilistic disregard of good manners, or by jeering at \"everything holy,\" at the very time when \"everything holy\" might have come in most useful. Our town doctor, Rozanov\u2014he too was an accoucheur\u2014asserted most positively that on one occasion when a patient in labour was crying out and calling on the name of the Almighty, a free-thinking sally from Arina Prohorovna, fired off like a pistol-shot, had so terrifying an effect on the patient that it greatly accelerated her delivery.\n\nBut though she was a nihilist, Madame Virginsky did not, when occasion arose, disdain social or even old-fashioned superstitions and customs if they could be of any advantage to herself. She would never, for instance, have stayed away from a baby's christening, and always put on a green silk dress with a train and adorned her chignon with curls and ringlets for such events, though at other times she positively revelled in slovenliness. And though during the ceremony she always maintained \"the most insolent air,\" so that she put the clergy to confusion, yet when it was over she invariably handed champagne to the guests (it was for that that she came and dressed up), and it was no use trying to take the glass without a contribution to her \"porridge bowl.\"\n\nThe guests who assembled that evening at Virginsky's (mostly men) had a casual and exceptional air. There was no supper nor cards. In the middle of the large drawing-room, which was papered with extremely old blue paper, two tables had been put together and covered with a large though not quite clean table-cloth, and on them two samovars were boiling. The end of the table was taken up by a huge tray with twenty-five glasses on it and a basket with ordinary French bread cut into a number of slices, as one sees it in genteel boarding-schools for boys or girls. The tea was poured out by a maiden lady of thirty, Arina Prohorovna's sister, a silent and malevolent creature, with flaxen hair and no eyebrows, who shared her sister's progressive ideas and was an object of terror to Virginsky himself in domestic life. There were only three ladies in the room: the lady of the house, her eyebrowless sister, and Virginsky's sister, a girl who had just arrived from Petersburg. Arina Prohorovna, a good-looking and buxom woman of seven-and-twenty, rather dishevelled, in an everyday greenish woollen dress, was sitting scanning the guests with her bold eyes, and her look seemed in haste to say, \"You see I am not in the least afraid of anything.\" Miss Virginsky, a rosy-cheeked student and a nihilist, who was also good-looking, short, plump and round as a little ball, had settled herself beside Arina Prohorovna, almost in her travelling clothes. She held a roll of paper in her hand, and scrutinised the guests with impatient and roving eyes. Virginsky himself was rather unwell that evening, but he came in and sat in an easy chair by the tea-table. All the guests were sitting down too, and the orderly way in which they were ranged on chairs suggested a meeting. Evidently all were expecting something and were filling up the interval with loud but irrelevant conversation. When Stavrogin and Verhovensky appeared there was a sudden hush.\n\nBut I must be allowed to give a few explanations to make things clear.\n\nI believe that all these people had come together in the agreeable expectation of hearing something particularly interesting, and had notice of it beforehand. They were the flower of the reddest Radicalism of our ancient town, and had been carefully picked out by Virginsky for this \"meeting.\" I may remark, too, that some of them (though not very many) had never visited him before. Of course most of the guests had no clear idea why they had been summoned. It was true that at that time all took Pyotr Stepanovitch for a fully authorised emissary from abroad; this idea had somehow taken root among them at once and naturally flattered them. And yet among the citizens assembled ostensibly to keep a name-day, there were some who had been approached with definite proposals. Pyotr Verhovensky had succeeded in getting together a \"quintet\" amongst us like the one he had already formed in Moscow and, as appeared later, in our province among the officers. It was said that he had another in X province. This quintet of the elect were sitting now at the general table, and very skilfully succeeded in giving themselves the air of being quite ordinary people, so that no one could have known them. They were\u2014since it is no longer a secret\u2014first Liputin, then Virginsky himself, then Shigalov (a gentleman with long ears, the brother of Madame Virginsky), Lyamshin, and lastly a strange person called Tolkatchenko, a man of forty, who was famed for his vast knowledge of the people, especially of thieves and robbers. He used to frequent the taverns on purpose (though not only with the object of studying the people), and plumed himself on his shabby clothes, tarred boots, and crafty wink and a flourish of peasant phrases. Lyamshin had once or twice brought him to Stepan Trofimovitch's gatherings, where, however, he did not make a great sensation. He used to make his appearance in the town from time to time, chiefly when he was out of a job; he was employed on the railway.\n\nEvery one of these fine champions had formed this first group in the fervent conviction that their quintet was only one of hundreds and thousands of similar groups scattered all over Russia, and that they all depended on some immense central but secret power, which in its turn was intimately connected with the revolutionary movement all over Europe. But I regret to say that even at that time there was beginning to be dissension among them. Though they had ever since the spring been expecting Pyotr Verhovensky, whose coming had been heralded first by Tolkatchenko and then by the arrival of Shigalov, though they had expected extraordinary miracles from him, and though they had responded to his first summons without the slightest criticism, yet they had no sooner formed the quintet than they all somehow seemed to feel insulted; and I really believe it was owing to the promptitude with which they consented to join. They had joined, of course, from a not ignoble feeling of shame, for fear people might say afterwards that they had not dared to join; still they felt Pyotr Verhovensky ought to have appreciated their heroism and have rewarded it by telling them some really important bits of news at least. But Verhovensky was not at all inclined to satisfy their legitimate curiosity, and told them nothing but what was necessary; he treated them in general with great sternness and even rather casually. This was positively irritating, and Comrade Shigalov was already egging the others on to insist on his \"explaining himself,\" though, of course, not at Virginsky's, where so many outsiders were present.\n\nI have an idea that the above-mentioned members of the first quintet were disposed to suspect that among the guests of Virginsky's that evening some were members of other groups, unknown to them, belonging to the same secret organisation and founded in the town by the same Verhovensky; so that in fact all present were suspecting one another, and posed in various ways to one another, which gave the whole party a very perplexing and even romantic air. Yet there were persons present who were beyond all suspicion. For instance, a major in the service, a near relation of Virginsky, a perfectly innocent person who had not been invited but had come of himself for the name-day celebration, so that it was impossible not to receive him. But Virginsky was quite unperturbed, as the major was \"incapable of betraying them\"; for in spite of his stupidity he had all his life been fond of dropping in wherever extreme Radicals met; he did not sympathise with their ideas himself, but was very fond of listening to them. What's more, he had even been compromised indeed. It had happened in his youth that whole bundles of manifestoes and of numbers of The Bell had passed through his hands, and although he had been afraid even to open them, yet he would have considered it absolutely contemptible to refuse to distribute them\u2014and there are such people in Russia even to this day.\n\nThe rest of the guests were either types of honourable amour-propre crushed and embittered, or types of the generous impulsiveness of ardent youth. There were two or three teachers, of whom one, a lame man of forty-five, a master in the high school, was a very malicious and strikingly vain person; and two or three officers. Of the latter, one very young artillery officer who had only just come from a military training school, a silent lad who had not yet made friends with anyone, turned up now at Virginsky's with a pencil in his hand, and, scarcely taking any part in the conversation, continually made notes in his notebook. Everybody saw this, but every one pretended not to. There was, too, an idle divinity student who had helped Lyamshin to put indecent photographs into the gospel-woman's pack. He was a solid youth with a free-and-easy though mistrustful manner, with an unchangeably satirical smile, together with a calm air of triumphant faith in his own perfection. There was also present, I don't know why, the mayor's son, that unpleasant and prematurely exhausted youth to whom I have referred already in telling the story of the lieutenant's little wife. He was silent the whole evening. Finally there was a very enthusiastic and tousle-headed schoolboy of eighteen, who sat with the gloomy air of a young man whose dignity has been wounded, evidently distressed by his eighteen years. This infant was already the head of an independent group of conspirators which had been formed in the highest class of the gymnasium, as it came out afterwards to the surprise of every one.\n\nI haven't mentioned Shatov. He was there at the farthest corner of the table, his chair pushed back a little out of the row. He gazed at the ground, was gloomily silent, refused tea and bread, and did not for one instant let his cap go out of his hand, as though to show that he was not a visitor, but had come on business, and when he liked would get up and go away. Kirillov was not far from him. He, too, was very silent, but he did not look at the ground; on the contrary, he scrutinised intently every speaker with his fixed, lustreless eyes, and listened to everything without the slightest emotion or surprise. Some of the visitors who had never seen him before stole thoughtful glances at him. I can't say whether Madame Virginsky knew anything about the existence of the quintet. I imagine she knew everything and from her husband. The girl-student, of course, took no part in anything; but she had an anxiety of her own: she intended to stay only a day or two and then to go on farther and farther from one university town to another \"to show active sympathy with the sufferings of poor students and to rouse them to protest.\" She was taking with her some hundreds of copies of a lithographed appeal, I believe of her own composition. It is remarkable that the schoolboy conceived an almost murderous hatred for her from the first moment, though he saw her for the first time in his life; and she felt the same for him. The major was her uncle, and met her to-day for the first time after ten years. When Stavrogin and Verhovensky came in, her cheeks were as red as cranberries: she had just quarrelled with her uncle over his views on the woman question.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbspII\n\nWith conspicuous nonchalance Verhovensky lounged in the chair at the upper end of the table, almost without greeting anyone. His expression was disdainful and even haughty. Stavrogin bowed politely, but in spite of the fact that they were all only waiting for them, everybody, as though acting on instruction, appeared scarcely to notice them. The lady of the house turned severely to Stavrogin as soon as he was seated.\n\n\"Stavrogin, will you have tea?\"\n\"Please,\" he answered.\n\n\"Tea for Stavrogin,\" she commanded her sister at the samovar. \"And you, will you?\" (This was to Verhovensky.)\n\n\"Of course. What a question to ask a visitor! And give me cream too; you always give one such filthy stuff by way of tea, and with a name-day party in the house!\"\n\n\"What, you believe in keeping name-days too!\" the girl-student laughed suddenly. \"We were just talking of that.\"\n\n\"That's stale,\" muttered the schoolboy at the other end of the table.\n\n\"What's stale? To disregard conventions, even the most innocent is not stale; on the contrary, to the disgrace of every one, so far it's a novelty,\" the girl-student answered instantly, darting forward on her chair. \"Besides, there are no innocent conventions,\" she added with intensity.\n\n\"I only meant,\" cried the schoolboy with tremendous excitement, \"to say that though conventions of course are stale and must be eradicated, yet about name-days everybody knows that they are stupid and very stale to waste precious time upon, which has been wasted already all over the world, so that it would be as well to sharpen one's wits on something more useful....\"\n\n\"You drag it out so, one can't understand what you mean,\" shouted the girl.\n\n\"I think that every one has a right to express an opinion as well as every one else, and if I want to express my opinion like anybody else...\"\n\n\"No one is attacking your right to give an opinion,\" the lady of the house herself cut in sharply. \"You were only asked not to ramble because no one can make out what you mean.\"\n\n\"But allow me to remark that you are not treating me with respect. If I couldn't fully express my thought, it's not from want of thought but from too much thought,\" the schoolboy muttered, almost in despair, losing his thread completely.\n\n\"If you don't know how to talk, you'd better keep quiet,\" blurted out the girl.\n\nThe schoolboy positively jumped from his chair.\n\"I only wanted to state,\" he shouted, crimson with shame and afraid to look about him, \"that you only wanted to show off your cleverness because Mr. Stavrogin came in\u2014so there!\"\n\n\"That's a nasty and immoral idea and shows the worthlessness of your development. I beg you not to address me again,\" the girl rattled off.\n\n\"Stavrogin,\" began the lady of the house, \"they've been discussing the rights of the family before you came\u2014this officer here\"\u2014she nodded towards her relation, the major\u2014\"and, of course, I am not going to worry you with such stale nonsense, which has been dealt with long ago. But how have the rights and duties of the family come about in the superstitious form in which they exist at present? That's the question. What's your opinion?\"\n\n\"What do you mean by 'come about'?\" Stavrogin asked in his turn.\n\n\"We know, for instance, that the superstition about God came from thunder and lightning.\" The girl-student rushed into the fray again, staring at Stavrogin with her eyes almost jumping out of her head. \"It's well known that primitive man, scared by thunder and lightning, made a god of the unseen enemy, feeling their weakness before it. But how did the superstition of the family arise? How did the family itself arise?\"\n\n\"That's not quite the same thing....\" Madame Virginsky tried to check her.\n\n\"I think the answer to this question wouldn't be quite discreet,\" answered Stavrogin.\n\n\"How so?\" said the girl-student, craning forward suddenly. But there was an audible titter in the group of teachers, which was at once caught up at the other end by Lyamshin and the schoolboy and followed by a hoarse chuckle from the major.\n\n\"You ought to write vaudevilles,\" Madame Virginsky observed to Stavrogin.\n\n\"It does you no credit, I don't know what your name is,\" the girl rapped out with positive indignation.\n\n\"And don't you be too forward,\" boomed the major. \"You are a young lady and you ought to behave modestly, and you keep jumping about as though you were sitting on a needle.\"\n\n\"Kindly hold your tongue and don't address me familiarly with your nasty comparisons. I've never seen you before and I don't recognise the relationship.\"\n\n\"But I am your uncle; I used to carry you about when you were a baby!\"\n\"I don't care what babies you used to carry about. I didn't ask you to carry me. It must have been a pleasure to you to do so, you rude officer. And allow me to observe, don't dare to address me so familiarly, unless it's as a fellow-citizen. I forbid you to do it, once for all.\"\n\n\"There, they are all like that!\" cried the major, banging the table with his fist and addressing Stavrogin, who was sitting opposite. \"But, allow me, I am fond of Liberalism and modern ideas, and I am fond of listening to clever conversation; masculine conversation, though, I warn you. But to listen to these women, these nightly windmills\u2014no, that makes me ache all over! Don't wriggle about!\" he shouted to the girl, who was leaping up from her chair. \"No, it's my turn to speak, I've been insulted.\"\n\n\"You can't say anything yourself, and only hinder other people talking,\" the lady of the house grumbled indignantly.\n\n\"No, I will have my say,\" said the major hotly, addressing Stavrogin. \"I reckon on you, Mr. Stavrogin, as a fresh person who has only just come on the scene, though I haven't the honour of knowing you. Without men they'll perish like flies\u2014that's what I think. All their woman question is only lack of originality. I assure you that all this woman question has been invented for them by men in foolishness and to their own hurt. I only thank God I am not married. There's not the slightest variety in them, they can't even invent a simple pattern; they have to get men to invent them for them! Here I used to carry her in my arms, used to dance the mazurka with her when she was ten years old; to-day she's come, naturally I fly to embrace her, and at the second word she tells me there's no God. She might have waited a little, she was in too great a hurry! Clever people don't believe, I dare say; but that's from their cleverness. But you, chicken, what do you know about God, I said to her. 'Some student taught you, and if he'd taught you to light the lamp before the ikons you would have lighted it.'\"\n\n\"You keep telling lies, you are a very spiteful person. I proved to you just now the untenability of your position,\" the girl answered contemptuously, as though disdaining further explanations with such a man. \"I told you just now that we've all been taught in the Catechism if you honour your father and your parents you will live long and have wealth. That's in the Ten Commandments. If God thought it necessary to offer rewards for love, your God must be immoral. That's how I proved it to you. It wasn't the second word, and it was because you asserted your rights. It's not my fault if you are stupid and don't understand even now. You are offended and you are spiteful\u2014and that's what explains all your generation.\"\n\n\"You're a goose!\" said the major.\n\n\"And you are a fool!\"\n\n\"You can call me names!\"\n\n\"Excuse me, Kapiton Maximitch, you told me yourself you don't believe in God,\" Liputin piped from the other end of the table.\n\n\"What if I did say so\u2014that's a different matter. I believe, perhaps, only not altogether. Even if I don't believe altogether, still I don't say God ought to be shot. I used to think about God before I left the hussars. From all the poems you would think that hussars do nothing but carouse and drink. Yes, I did drink, maybe, but would you believe it, I used to jump out of bed at night and stood crossing myself before the images with nothing but my socks on, praying to God to give me faith; for even then I couldn't be at peace as to whether there was a God or not. It used to fret me so! In the morning, of course, one would amuse oneself and one's faith would seem to be lost again; and in fact I've noticed that faith always seems to be less in the daytime.\"\n\n\"Haven't you any cards?\" asked Verhovensky, with a mighty yawn, addressing Madame Virginsky.\n\n\"I sympathise with your question, I sympathise entirely,\" the girl-student broke in hotly, flushed with indignation at the major's words.\n\n\"We are wasting precious time listening to silly talk,\" snapped out the lady of the house, and she looked reprovingly at her husband.\n\nThe girl pulled herself together.\n\n\"I wanted to make a statement to the meeting concerning the sufferings of the students and their protest, but as time is being wasted in immoral conversation...\"\n\n\"There's no such thing as moral or immoral,\" the schoolboy brought out, unable to restrain himself as soon as the girl began.\n\n\"I knew that, Mr. Schoolboy, long before you were taught it.\"\n\n\"And I maintain,\" he answered savagely, \"that you are a child come from Petersburg to enlighten us all, though we know for ourselves the commandment 'honour thy father and thy mother,' which you could not repeat correctly; and the fact that it's immoral every one in Russia knows from Byelinsky.\"\n\n\"Are we ever to have an end of this?\" Madame Virginsky said resolutely to her husband. As the hostess, she blushed for the ineptitude of the conversation, especially as she noticed smiles and even astonishment among the guests who had been invited for the first time.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said Virginsky, suddenly lifting up his voice, \"if anyone wishes to say anything more nearly connected with our business, or has any statement to make, I call upon him to do so without wasting time.\"\n\n\"I'll venture to ask one question,\" said the lame teacher suavely. He had been sitting particularly decorously and had not spoken till then. \"I should like to know, are we some sort of meeting, or are we simply a gathering of ordinary mortals paying a visit? I ask simply for the sake of order and so as not to remain in ignorance.\"\n\nThis \"sly\" question made an impression. People looked at each other, every one expecting some one else to answer, and suddenly all, as though at a word of command, turned their eyes to Verhovensky and Stavrogin.\n\n\"I suggest our voting on the answer to the question whether we are a meeting or not,\" said Madame Virginsky.\n\n\"I entirely agree with the suggestion,\" Liputin chimed in, \"though the question is rather vague.\"\n\n\"I agree too.\"\n\n\"And so do I,\" cried voices. \"I too think it would make our proceedings more in order,\" confirmed Virginsky.\n\n\"To the vote then,\" said his wife. \"Lyamshin, please sit down to the piano; you can give your vote from there when the voting begins.\"\n\n\"Again!\" cried Lyamshin. \"I've strummed enough for you.\"\n\n\"I beg you most particularly, sit down and play. Don't you care to do anything for the cause?\"\n\n\"But I assure you, Arina Prohorovna, nobody is eavesdropping. It's only your fancy. Besides, the windows are high, and people would not understand if they did hear.\"\n\n\"We don't understand ourselves,\" some one muttered. \"But I tell you one must always be on one's guard. I mean in case there should be spies,\" she explained to Verhovensky. \"Let them hear from the street that we have music and a name-day party.\"\n\n\"Hang it all!\" Lyamshin swore, and sitting down to the piano, began strumming a valse, banging on the keys almost with his fists, at random.\n\n\"I propose that those who want it to be a meeting should put up their right hands,\" Madame Virginsky proposed.\n\nSome put them up, others did not. Some held them up and then put them down again and then held them up again. \"Foo! I don't understand it at all,\" one officer shouted. \"I don't either,\" cried the other.\n\n\"Oh, I understand,\" cried a third. \"If it's yes, you hold your hand up.\"\n\n\"But what does 'yes' mean?\"\n\n\"Means a meeting.\"\n\n\"No, it means not a meeting.\"\n\n\"I voted for a meeting,\" cried the schoolboy to Madame Virginsky.\n\n\"Then why didn't you hold up your hand?\"\n\n\"I was looking at you. You didn't hold up yours, so I didn't hold up mine.\"\n\n\"How stupid! I didn't hold up my hand because I proposed it. Gentlemen, now I propose the contrary. Those who want a meeting, sit still and do nothing; those who don't, hold up their right hands.\"\n\n\"Those who don't want it?\" inquired the schoolboy. \"Are you doing it on purpose?\" cried Madame Virginsky wrathfully.\n\n\"No. Excuse me, those who want it, or those who don't want it? For one must know that definitely,\" cried two or three voices.\n\n\"Those who don't want it\u2014those who don't want it.\"\n\n\"Yes, but what is one to do, hold up one's hand or not hold it up if one doesn't want it?\" cried an officer.\n\n\"Ech, we are not accustomed to constitutional methods yet!\" remarked the major.\n\n\"Mr. Lyamshin, excuse me, but you are thumping so that no one can hear anything,\" observed the lame teacher.\n\n\"But, upon my word, Arina Prohorovna, nobody is listening, really!\" cried Lyamshin, jumping up. \"I won't play! I've come to you as a visitor, not as a drummer!\"\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" Virginsky went on, \"answer verbally, are we a meeting or not?\"\n\n\"We are! We are!\" was heard on all sides. \"If so, there's no need to vote, that's enough. Are you satisfied, gentlemen? Is there any need to put it to the vote?\"\n\n\"No need\u2014no need, we understand.\"\n\n\"Perhaps some one doesn't want it to be a meeting?\"\n\n\"No, no; we all want it.\"\n\n\"But what does 'meeting' mean?\" cried a voice. No one answered.\n\n\"We must choose a chairman,\" people cried from different parts of the room.\n\n\"Our host, of course, our host!\"\n\n\"Gentlemen, if so,\" Virginsky, the chosen chairman, began, \"I propose my original motion. If anyone wants to say anything more relevant to the subject, or has some statement to make, let him bring it forward without loss of time.\"\n\nThere was a general silence. The eyes of all were turned again on Verhovensky and Stavrogin.\n\n\"Verhovensky, have you no statement to make?\" Madame Virginsky asked him directly.\n\n\"Nothing whatever,\" he answered, yawning and stretching on his chair. \"But I should like a glass of brandy.\"\n\n\"Stavrogin, don't you want to?\"\n\n\"Thank you, I don't drink.\"\n\n\"I mean don't you want to speak, not don't you want brandy.\"\n\n\"To speak, what about? No, I don't want to.\"\n\n\"They'll bring you some brandy,\" she answered Verhovensky.\n\nThe girl-student got up. She had darted up several times already.\n\n\"I have come to make a statement about the sufferings of poor students and the means of rousing them to protest.\"\n\nBut she broke off. At the other end of the table a rival had risen, and all eyes turned to him. Shigalov, the man with the long ears, slowly rose from his seat with a gloomy and sullen air and mournfully laid on the table a thick notebook filled with extremely small handwriting. He remained standing in silence. Many people looked at the notebook in consternation, but Liputin, Virginsky, and the lame teacher seemed pleased.\n\n\"I ask leave to address the meeting,\" Shigalov pronounced sullenly but resolutely.\n\n\"You have leave.\" Virginsky gave his sanction.\n\nThe orator sat down, was silent for half a minute, and pronounced in a solemn voice,\n\n\"Gentlemen!\"\n\n\"Here's the brandy,\" the sister who had been pouring out tea and had gone to fetch brandy rapped out, contemptuously and disdainfully putting the bottle before Verhovensky, together with the wineglass which she brought in her fingers without a tray or a plate.\n\nThe interrupted orator made a dignified pause.\n\n\"Never mind, go on, I am not listening,\" cried Verhovensky, pouring himself out a glass.\n\n\"Gentlemen, asking your attention and, as you will see later, soliciting your aid in a matter of the first importance,\" Shigalov began again, \"I must make some prefatory remarks.\"\n\n\"Arina Prohorovna, haven't you some scissors?\" Pyotr Stepanovitch asked suddenly.\n\n\"What do you want scissors for?\" she asked, with wide-open eyes.\n\n\"I've forgotten to cut my nails; I've been meaning to for the last three days,\" he observed, scrutinising his long and dirty nails with unruffled composure.\n\nArina Prohorovna crimsoned, but Miss Virginsky seemed pleased.\n\n\"I believe I saw them just now on the window.\" She got up from the table, went and found the scissors, and at once brought them. Pyotr Stepanovitch did not even look at her, took the scissors, and set to work with them. Arina Prohorovna grasped that these were realistic manners, and was ashamed of her sensitiveness. People looked at one another in silence. The lame teacher looked vindictively and enviously at Verhovensky. Shigalov went on.\n\n\"Dedicating my energies to the study of the social organisation which is in the future to replace the present condition of things, I've come to the conviction that all makers of social systems from ancient times up to the present year, 187-, have been dreamers, tellers of fairy-tales, fools who contradicted themselves, who understood nothing of natural science and the strange animal called man. Plato, Rousseau, Fourier, columns of aluminium, are only fit for sparrows and not for human society. But, now that we are all at last preparing to act, a new form of social organisation is essential. In order to avoid further uncertainty, I propose my own system of world-organisation. Here it is.\" He tapped the notebook. \"I wanted to expound my views to the meeting in the most concise form possible, but I see that I should need to add a great many verbal explanations, and so the whole exposition would occupy at least ten evenings, one for each of my chapters.\" (There was the sound of laughter.) \"I must add, besides, that my system is not yet complete.\" (Laughter again.) \"I am perplexed by my own data and my conclusion is a direct contradiction of the original idea with which I start. Starting from unlimited freedom, I arrive at unlimited despotism. I will add, however, that there can be no solution of the social problem but mine.\"\n\nThe laughter grew louder and louder, but it came chiefly from the younger and less initiated visitors. There was an expression of some annoyance on the faces of Madame Virginsky, Liputin, and the lame teacher.\n\n\"If you've been unsuccessful in making your system consistent, and have been reduced to despair yourself, what could we do with it?\" one officer observed warily.\n\n\"You are right, Mr. Officer\"\u2014Shigalov turned sharply to him\u2014\"especially in using the word despair. Yes, I am reduced to despair. Nevertheless, nothing can take the place of the system set forth in my book, and there is no other way out of it; no one can invent anything else. And so I hasten without loss of time to invite the whole society to listen for ten evenings to my book and then give their opinions of it. If the members are unwilling to listen to me, let us break up from the start\u2014the men to take up service under government, the women to their cooking; for if you reject my solution you'll find no other, none whatever! If they let the opportunity slip, it will simply be their loss, for they will be bound to come back to it again.\"\n\nThere was a stir in the company. \"Is he mad, or what?\" voices asked.\n\n\"So the whole point lies in Shigalov's despair,\" Lyamshin commented, \"and the essential question is whether he must despair or not?\"\n\n\"Shigalov's being on the brink of despair is a personal question,\" declared the schoolboy.\n\n\"I propose we put it to the vote how far Shigalov's despair affects the common cause, and at the same time whether it's worth while listening to him or not,\" an officer suggested gaily.\n\n\"That's not right.\" The lame teacher put in his spoke at last. As a rule he spoke with a rather mocking smile, so that it was difficult to make out whether he was in earnest or joking. \"That's not right, gentlemen. Mr. Shigalov is too much devoted to his task and is also too modest. I know his book. He suggests as a final solution of the question the division of mankind into two unequal parts. One-tenth enjoys absolute liberty and unbounded power over the other nine-tenths. The others have to give up all individuality and become, so to speak, a herd, and, through boundless submission, will by a series of regenerations attain prim\u00e6val innocence, something like the Garden of Eden. They'll have to work, however. The measures proposed by the author for depriving nine-tenths of mankind of their freedom and transforming them into a herd through the education of whole generations are very remarkable, founded on the facts of nature and highly logical. One may not agree with some of the deductions, but it would be difficult to doubt the intelligence and knowledge of the author. It's a pity that the time required\u2014ten evenings\u2014is impossible to arrange for, or we might hear a great deal that's interesting.\"\n\n\"Can you be in earnest?\" Madame Virginsky addressed the lame gentleman with a shade of positive uneasiness in her voice, \"when that man doesn't know what to do with people and so turns nine-tenths of them into slaves? I've suspected him for a long time.\"\n\n\"You say that of your own brother?\" asked the lame man.\n\n\"Relationship? Are you laughing at me?\"\n\n\"And besides, to work for aristocrats and to obey them as though they were gods is contemptible!\" observed the girl-student fiercely.\n\n\"What I propose is not contemptible; it's paradise, an earthly paradise, and there can be no other on earth,\" Shigalov pronounced authoritatively.\n\n\"For my part,\" said Lyamshin, \"if I didn't know what to do with nine-tenths of mankind, I'd take them and blow them up into the air instead of putting them in paradise. I'd only leave a handful of educated people, who would live happily ever afterwards on scientific principles.\"\n\n\"No one but a buffoon can talk like that!\" cried the girl, flaring up.\n\n\"He is a buffoon, but he is of use,\" Madame Virginsky whispered to her.\n\n\"And possibly that would be the best solution of the problem,\" said Shigalov, turning hotly to Lyamshin. \"You certainly don't know what a profound thing you've succeeded in saying, my merry friend. But as it's hardly possible to carry out your idea, we must confine ourselves to an earthly paradise, since that's what they call it.\"\n\n\"This is pretty thorough rot,\" broke, as though involuntarily, from Verhovensky. Without even raising his eyes, however, he went on cutting his nails with perfect nonchalance.\n\n\"Why is it rot?\" The lame man took it up instantly, as though he had been lying in wait for his first words to catch at them. \"Why is it rot? Mr. Shigalov is somewhat fanatical in his love for humanity, but remember that Fourier, still more Cabet and even Proudhon himself, advocated a number of the most despotic and even fantastic measures. Mr. Shigalov is perhaps far more sober in his suggestions than they are. I assure you that when one reads his book it's almost impossible not to agree with some things. He is perhaps less far from realism than anyone and his earthly paradise is almost the real one\u2014if it ever existed\u2014for the loss of which man is always sighing.\"\n\n\"I knew I was in for something,\" Verhovensky muttered again.\n\n\"Allow me,\" said the lame man, getting more and more excited. \"Conversations and arguments about the future organisation of society are almost an actual necessity for all thinking people nowadays. Herzen was occupied with nothing else all his life. Byelinsky, as I know on very good authority, used to spend whole evenings with his friends debating and settling beforehand even the minutest, so to speak, domestic, details of the social organisation of the future.\"\n\n\"Some people go crazy over it,\" the major observed suddenly.\n\n\"We are more likely to arrive at something by talking, anyway, than by sitting silent and posing as dictators,\" Liputin hissed, as though at last venturing to begin the attack.\n\n\"I didn't mean Shigalov when I said it was rot,\" Verhovensky mumbled. \"You see, gentlemen,\"\u2014he raised his eyes a trifle\u2014\"to my mind all these books, Fourier, Cabet, all this talk about the right to work, and Shigalov's theories\u2014are all like novels of which one can write a hundred thousand\u2014an \u00e6sthetic entertainment. I can understand that in this little town you are bored, so you rush to ink and paper.\"\n\n\"Excuse me,\" said the lame man, wriggling on his chair, \"though we are provincials and of course objects of commiseration on that ground, yet we know that so far nothing has happened in the world new enough to be worth our weeping at having missed it. It is suggested to us in various pamphlets made abroad and secretly distributed that we should unite and form groups with the sole object of bringing about universal destruction. It's urged that, however much you tinker with the world, you can't make a good job of it, but that by cutting off a hundred million heads and so lightening one's burden, one can jump over the ditch more safely. A fine idea, no doubt, but quite as impracticable as Shigalov's theories, which you referred to just now so contemptuously.\"\n\n\"Well, but I haven't come here for discussion.\" Verhovensky let drop this significant phrase, and, as though quite unaware of his blunder, drew the candle nearer to him that he might see better.\n\n\"It's a pity, a great pity, that you haven't come for discussion, and it's a great pity that you are so taken up just now with your toilet.\"\n\n\"What's my toilet to you?\"\n\n\"To remove a hundred million heads is as difficult as to transform the world by propaganda. Possibly more difficult, especially in Russia,\" Liputin ventured again.\n\n\"It's Russia they rest their hopes on now,\" said an officer.\n\n\"We've heard they are resting their hopes on it,\" interposed the lame man. \"We know that a mysterious finger is pointing to our delightful country as the land most fitted to accomplish the great task. But there's this: by the gradual solution of the problem by propaganda I shall gain something, anyway\u2014I shall have some pleasant talk, at least, and shall even get some recognition from government for my services to the cause of society. But in the second way, by the rapid method of cutting off a hundred million heads, what benefit shall I get personally? If you began advocating that, your tongue might be cut out.\"\n\n\"Yours certainly would be,\" observed Verhovensky.\n\n\"You see. And as under the most favourable circumstances you would not get through such a massacre in less than fifty or at the best thirty years\u2014for they are not sheep, you know, and perhaps they would not let themselves be slaughtered\u2014wouldn't it be better to pack one's bundle and migrate to some quiet island beyond calm seas and there close one's eyes tranquilly? Believe me\"\u2014he tapped the table significantly with his finger\u2014\"you will only promote emigration by such propaganda and nothing else!\"\n\nHe finished evidently triumphant. He was one of the intellects of the province. Liputin smiled slyly, Virginsky listened rather dejectedly, the others followed the discussion with great attention, especially the ladies and officers. They all realised that the advocate of the hundred million heads theory had been driven into a corner, and waited to see what would come of it.\n\n\"That was a good saying of yours, though,\" Verhovensky mumbled more carelessly than ever, in fact with an air of positive boredom. \"Emigration is a good idea. But all the same, if in spite of all the obvious disadvantages you foresee, more and more come forward every day ready to fight for the common cause, it will be able to do without you. It's a new religion, my good friend, coming to take the place of the old one. That's why so many fighters come forward, and it's a big movement. You'd better emigrate! And, you know, I should advise Dresden, not 'the calm islands.' To begin with, it's a town that has never been visited by an epidemic, and as you are a man of culture, no doubt you are afraid of death. Another thing, it's near the Russian frontier, so you can more easily receive your income from your beloved Fatherland. Thirdly, it contains what are called treasures of art, and you are a man of \u00e6sthetic tastes, formerly a teacher of literature, I believe. And, finally, it has a miniature Switzerland of its own\u2014to provide you with poetic inspiration, for no doubt you write verse. In fact it's a treasure in a nutshell!\" There was a general movement, especially among the officers. In another instant they would have all begun talking at once. But the lame man rose irritably to the bait.\n\n\"No, perhaps I am not going to give up the common cause. You must understand that...\"\n\n\"What, would you join the quintet if I proposed it to you?\" Verhovensky boomed suddenly, and he laid down the scissors.\n\nEvery one seemed startled. The mysterious man had revealed himself too freely. He had even spoken openly of the \"quintet.\"\n\n\"Every one feels himself to be an honest man and will not shirk his part in the common cause\"\u2014the lame man tried to wriggle out of it\u2014\"but...\"\n\n\"No, this is not a question which allows of a but,\" Verhovensky interrupted harshly and peremptorily. \"I tell you, gentlemen, I must have a direct answer. I quite understand that, having come here and having called you together myself, I am bound to give you explanations\" (again an unexpected revelation), \"but I can give you none till I know what is your attitude to the subject. To cut the matter short\u2014for we can't go on talking for another thirty years as people have done for the last thirty\u2014I ask you which you prefer: the slow way, which consists in the composition of socialistic romances and the academic ordering of the destinies of humanity a thousand years hence, while despotism will swallow the savoury morsels which would almost fly into your mouths of themselves if you'd take a little trouble; or do you, whatever it may imply, prefer a quicker way which will at last untie your hands, and will let humanity make its own social organisation in freedom and in action, not on paper? They shout 'a hundred million heads'; that may be only a metaphor; but why be afraid of it if, with the slow day-dream on paper, despotism in the course of some hundred years will devour not a hundred but five hundred million heads? Take note too that an incurable invalid will not be cured whatever prescriptions are written for him on paper. On the contrary, if there is delay, he will grow so corrupt that he will infect us too and contaminate all the fresh forces which one might still reckon upon now, so that we shall all at last come to grief together. I thoroughly agree that it's extremely agreeable to chatter liberally and eloquently, but action is a little trying.... However, I am no hand at talking; I came here with communications, and so I beg all the honourable company not to vote, but simply and directly to state which you prefer: walking at a snail's pace in the marsh, or putting on full steam to get across it?\"\n\n\"I am certainly for crossing at full steam!\" cried the schoolboy in an ecstasy.\n\n\"So am I,\" Lyamshin chimed in.\n\n\"There can be no doubt about the choice,\" muttered an officer, followed by another, then by some one else. What struck them all most was that Verhovensky had come \"with communications\" and had himself just promised to speak.\n\n\"Gentlemen, I see that almost all decide for the policy of the manifestoes,\" he said, looking round at the company.\n\n\"All, all!\" cried the majority of voices.\n\n\"I confess I am rather in favour of a more humane policy,\" said the major, \"but as all are on the other side, I go with all the rest.\"\n\n\"It appears, then, that even you are not opposed to it,\" said Verhovensky, addressing the lame man.\n\n\"I am not exactly...\" said the latter, turning rather red, \"but if I do agree with the rest now, it's simply not to break up\u2014\"\n\n\"You are all like that! Ready to argue for six months to practise your Liberal eloquence and in the end you vote the same as the rest! Gentlemen, consider though, is it true that you are all ready?\"\n\n(Ready for what? The question was vague, but very alluring.)\n\n\"All are, of course!\" voices were heard. But all were looking at one another.\n\n\"But afterwards perhaps you will resent having agreed so quickly? That's almost always the way with you.\"\n\nThe company was excited in various ways, greatly excited. The lame man flew at him.\n\n\"Allow me to observe, however, that answers to such questions are conditional. Even if we have given our decision, you must note that questions put in such a strange way...\"\n\n\"In what strange way?\"\n\n\"In a way such questions are not asked.\"\n\n\"Teach me how, please. But do you know, I felt sure you'd be the first to take offence.\"\n\n\"You've extracted from us an answer as to our readiness for immediate action; but what right had you to do so? By what authority do you ask such questions?\"\n\n\"You should have thought of asking that question sooner! Why did you answer? You agree and then you go back on it!\"\n\n\"But to my mind the irresponsibility of your principal question suggests to me that you have no authority, no right, and only asked from personal curiosity.\"\n\n\"What do you mean? What do you mean?\" cried Verhovensky, apparently beginning to be much alarmed.\n\n\"Why, that the initiation of new members into anything you like is done, anyway, t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate and not in the company of twenty people one doesn't know!\" blurted out the lame man. He had said all that was in his mind because he was too irritated to restrain himself. Verhovensky turned to the general company with a capitally simulated look of alarm.\n\n\"Gentlemen, I deem it my duty to declare that all this is folly, and that our conversation has gone too far. I have so far initiated no one, and no one has the right to say of me that I initiate members. We were simply discussing our opinions. That's so, isn't it? But whether that's so or not, you alarm me very much.\" He turned to the lame man again. \"I had no idea that it was unsafe here to speak of such practically innocent matters except t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate. Are you afraid of informers? Can there possibly be an informer among us here?\"\n\nThe excitement became tremendous; all began talking.\n\n\"Gentlemen, if that is so,\" Verhovensky went on, \"I have compromised myself more than anyone, and so I will ask you to answer one question, if you care to, of course. You are all perfectly free.\"\n\n\"What question? What question?\" every one clamoured.\n\n\"A question that will make it clear whether we are to remain together, or take up our hats and go our several ways without speaking.\"\n\n\"The question! The question!\"\n\n\"If any one of us knew of a proposed political murder, would he, in view of all the consequences, go to give information, or would he stay at home and await events? Opinions may differ on this point. The answer to the question will tell us clearly whether we are to separate, or to remain together and for far longer than this one evening. Let me appeal to you first.\" He turned to the lame man.\n\n\"Why to me first?\"\n\n\"Because you began it all. Be so good as not to prevaricate; it won't help you to be cunning. But please yourself, it's for you to decide.\"\n\n\"Excuse me, but such a question is positively insulting.\"\n\n\"No, can't you be more exact than that?\"\n\n\"I've never been an agent of the Secret Police,\" replied the latter, wriggling more than ever.\n\n\"Be so good as to be more definite, don't keep us waiting.\"\n\nThe lame man was so furious that he left off answering. Without a word he glared wrathfully from under his spectacles at his tormentor.\n\n\"Yes or no? Would you inform or not?\" cried Verhovensky.\n\n\"Of course I wouldn't,\" the lame man shouted twice as loudly.\n\n\"And no one would, of course not!\" cried many voices.\n\n\"Allow me to appeal to you, Mr. Major. Would you inform or not?\" Verhovensky went on. \"And note that I appeal to you on purpose.\"\n\n\"I won't inform.\"\n\n\"But if you knew that some one meant to rob and murder some one else, an ordinary mortal, then you would inform and give warning?\"\n\n\"Yes, of course; but that's a private affair, while the other would be a political treachery. I've never been an agent of the Secret Police.\"\n\n\"And no one here has,\" voices cried again. \"It's an unnecessary question. Every one will make the same answer. There are no informers here.\"\n\n\"What is that gentleman getting up for?\" cried the girl-student.\n\n\"That's Shatov. What are you getting up for?\" cried the lady of the house.\n\nShatov did, in fact, stand up. He was holding his cap in his hand and looking at Verhovensky. Apparently he wanted to say something to him, but was hesitating. His face was pale and wrathful, but he controlled himself. He did not say one word, but in silence walked towards the door.\n\n\"Shatov, this won't make things better for you!\" Verhovensky called after him enigmatically.\n\n\"But it will for you, since you are a spy and a scoundrel!\" Shatov shouted to him from the door, and he went out.\n\nShouts and exclamations again.\n\n\"That's what comes of a test,\" cried a voice.\n\n\"It's been of use,\" cried another.\n\n\"Hasn't it been of use too late?\" observed a third.\n\n\"Who invited him? Who let him in? Who is he? Who is Shatov? Will he inform, or won't he?\" There was a shower of questions.\n\n\"If he were an informer he would have kept up appearances instead of cursing it all and going away,\" observed some one.\n\n\"See, Stavrogin is getting up too. Stavrogin has not answered the question either,\" cried the girl-student.\n\nStavrogin did actually stand up, and at the other end of the table Kirillov rose at the same time.\n\n\"Excuse me, Mr. Stavrogin,\" Madame Virginsky addressed him sharply, \"we all answered the question, while you are going away without a word.\"\n\n\"I see no necessity to answer the question which interests you,\" muttered Stavrogin.\n\n\"But we've compromised ourselves and you won't,\" shouted several voices.\n\n\"What business is it of mine if you have compromised yourselves?\" laughed Stavrogin, but his eyes flashed.\n\n\"What business? What business?\" voices exclaimed.\n\nMany people got up from their chairs.\n\n\"Allow me, gentlemen, allow me,\" cried the lame man. \"Mr. Verhovensky hasn't answered the question either; he has only asked it.\"\n\nThe remark produced a striking effect. All looked at one another. Stavrogin laughed aloud in the lame man's face and went out; Kirillov followed him; Verhovensky ran after them into the passage.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" he faltered, seizing Stavrogin's hand and gripping it with all his might in his. Stavrogin pulled away his hand without a word.\n\nBe at Kirillov's directly, I'll come.... It's absolutely necessary for me to see you!...\"\n\n\"It isn't necessary for me,\" Stavrogin cut him short.\n\n\"Stavrogin will be there,\" Kirillov said finally. \"Stavrogin, it is necessary for you. I will show you that there.\"\n\nThey went out.Embed",

Let's get this straight.\nMarty is your kid, not mine.\nAll the world's money\nwouldn't help that lazy bum.\nStop it, Biff. Just stop it.\nLook at him.\nHe's a butthead,\njust like his old man was.\nDon't you dare speak\nthat way about George.\nYou're not even half the man he was.\nYou son of a bitch !\nAlways the little hothead ?\nYou want to take a poke at me ?\nDamn it, Biff.\nThat's it. I'm leaving.\nSo go ahead.\nThink about this, Lorraine !\nWho's going to pay for your clothes ?\nAnd your jewelry and liquor ?\nWho's going to pay\nfor your cosmetic surgery ?\nYou were the one\nwho wanted me to get these things.\nIf you want them back,\nyou can have them.\nLook, Lorraine.\nYou leave and I won't only cut off you,\nI'll cut off your kids.\n- You wouldn't.\n- Wouldn't I ?\nFirst your daughter Linda.\nI'll cancel all her credit cards.\nShe'll settle her debts\nwith the bank herself.\nI'll have your idiot son\nDave's probation revoked.\nAnd as for Marty...\nmaybe you'd like to have\nall of your kids behind bars...\njust like your brother Joey.\nOne big happy jailbird family.\nAll right, Biff. You win. I'll stay.\nAs for you, I'll be back up here\nin an hour, so you better not be.\nHe was right, and I was wrong.\nMom, what're you saying ?\nYou're actually defending him.\nI had it coming.\nHe's my husband,\nand he takes care of all of us...\n- and he deserves our respect.\n- Respect ?\nYour husband !\nHow could he be your husband ?\n- How could you leave Dad for him ?\n- Leave Dad ?\n- Marty, are you feeling all right ?\n- No, I'm not feeling all right !\nI don't understand what's going on here.\nWhy nobody can give me a simple,\nstraight answer.\nThey must have hit you over the head\nhard this time.\nMom, I just want to know one thing.\nWhere's my father ?\nWhere's George McFly ?\nGeorge, your father, is in the same place\nhe's been for the past 12 years.\nOak Park Cemetery.\nNo ! This can't be happening !\n\"March 15, 1973\".\nNo ! Please, God, no !\nNo, please, God. Please, God, no.\nThis can't be happening.\nThis can't be happening.\nThis can't be...\nI'm afraid it is happening. All of it.\nWhen I learned about your father,\nI figured you'd come here.\nThen you know\nwhat happened to him ?\nDo you know what happened...\nMarch 15, 1973 ?\nYes, Marty. I know.\nI went to the public library\nto make sense of the madness.\nThe place was boarded up.\nI broke in and borrowed newspapers.\nI don't get it, Doc.\nHow can all this be happening ?\nIt's like we're in Hell or something.\nNo, it's Hill Valley, although\nI can't imagine Hell being much worse.\nEinie. I'm sorry, boy.\nThe lab is an awful, awful mess.\nAttaboy.\nObviously,\nthe time continuum has been disrupted...\ncreating this new\ntemporal event sequence...\n- resulting in this alternate reality.\n- English, Doc.\nHere, here. Let me illustrate.\nImagine that this line represents time.\nHere's the present, 1985,\nthe future, and the past.\nPrior to this point in time,\nsomewhere in the past...\nthe time line skewed\ninto this tangent...\ncreating an alternate 1985.\nAlternate to you, me, and Einstein...\nbut reality for everyone else.\nRecognize this ?\nIt's the bag the sports book came in.\nI know, because the receipt\nwas still inside.\nI found them in the time machine,\nalong with this.\nIt's the top of Biff's cane.\nI mean old Biff, from the future.\nCorrect. It was in the time machine\nbecause Biff was in the time machine...\nwith the Sports Almanac.\nHoly shit.\nYou see, while we were in the future...\nBiff got the sports book, stole\nthe time machine, went back in time...\nand gave the book to himself\nat some point in the past.\nLook. It says right here...\nthat Biff made his first $1,000,000\nbetting on a horserace in 1958.\nHe wasn't just lucky.\nHe knew, because he had\nthe race results in the Sports Almanac.\nThat's how he made his entire fortune.\nLook at his pocket\nwith a magnifying glass.\nThe Almanac.\nSon of a bitch stole my idea.\nHe must have been listening when I...\nIt's my fault.\nThe whole thing is my fault.\nIf I hadn't bought that damn book...\nnone of this would have happened.\n- It's all in the past.\n- The future.\nWhatever. It demonstrates precisely\nhow time travel can be misused...\nand why the time machine\nmust be destroyed...\nafter we straighten all of this out.\nRight. So we go back to the future...\nand we stop Biff\nfrom stealing the time machine.\nWe can't, because if we travel\ninto the future from this point in time...\nit will be the future of this reality...\nin which Biff is corrupt and powerful...\nand married to your mother,\nand in which...\nthis has happened to me.\nNo. Our only chance to repair\nthe present is in the past...\nat the point where the time line\nskewed into this tangent.\nIn order to put the universe back\nas we remember it...\nand get back to our reality,\nwe have to find out the exact date...\nand the specific circumstances\nof how, where, and when...\nyoung Biff got his hands\non that \"Sports Almanac\".\nI'll ask him.\nBulletproof vest ! Great flick !\nGreat frigging flick !\nThe guy is brilliant.\nWhat the hell's going...\n- What the hell are you doing in here ?\n- Party's over, Biff.\nSorry, ladies.\nHow did you get past\nmy security downstairs ?\nThere's a matter\nwe need to talk about.\n- Yeah. Money, right ? Well, forget it.\n- No. Not money.\nGray's Sports Almanac.\nYou heard him, girls.\nParty's over.\nStart talking, kid.\nWhat else do you know about that book ?\nFirst you tell me how you got it.\nHow, where, and when.\nAll right. Take a seat.\nSit down !\nNovember 12, 1955. That was when.\nNovember 12, 1955.\nThat was the date I went back...\nThat was the date of the famous\nHill Valley lightning storm.\nYou know your history. Very good.\nI'll never forget that Saturday.\nI'd picked my car up from the shop\nbecause I'd rolled it in a drag race.\nI thought you crashed\ninto a manure truck.\nHow do you know about that ?\nMy father told me about it.\nYour father ?\nBefore he died.\nYeah. Right.\nSo there I was,\nminding my own business.\nThis crazy old codger\nwith a cane shows up.\nHe says he's my distant relative.\nI don't see any resemblance.\nSo he says,\n\"How would you like to be rich ?\"\nSo I said, \"Sure\".\nSo he lays this book on me.\nHe says this book will tell me the outcome\nof every sporting event this century.\nAll I have to do is bet on the winner\nand I'll never lose.\nSo I said, \"What's the catch ?\" He says,\n\"No catch. Just keep it a secret.\"\nAfter that, he disappeared.\nI never saw him again.\nHe told me one more thing.\nHe said, \"Someday a crazy,\nwild-eyed scientist...\n\"or a kid may show up\nasking about that book.\n\"And if that ever happens...\nFunny. I never thought it would be you.\nBiff, you're forgetting one thing.\nWhat the hell is that ?\nYou're dead, you little son of a bitch !\n- There he is !\n- Wait, kid !\nHurry ! There he is !\nGo ahead, kid. Jump.\nA suicide will be nice and neat.\nWhat if I don't ?\nLead poisoning.\nWhat about the police, Biff ?\nThey're going to match\nthe bullet with that gun.\nKid, I own the police.\nBesides, they couldn't match up\nthe bullet that killed your old man.\nYou son of a...\nI suppose it's poetic justice.\nTwo McFlys with the same gun.\nIdiot.\nWhat the hell...\nNice job, Doc !\nYou're not going to believe this.\nWe've got to go back to 1955.\nI don't believe it.\nThat's right, Doc.\nNovember 12, 1955.\nUnbelievable that old Biff\ncould've chosen that particular date.\nIt could mean that that point in time\ncontains some cosmic significance...\nas if it were the temporal junction point\nof the entire space-time continuum...\nor it could just be\nan amazing coincidence.\nDamn ! Got to fix that thing.\nAll right. Time circuits on.\nWhat do you mean, time circuits on ?\nDoc, we're not going back now.\nWhat about Jennifer ? Einstein ?\nWe can't leave them.\nDon't worry.\nAssuming we succeed on our mission...\nthis alternate 1985\nwill be changed into the real 1985...\ninstantaneously transforming\naround Jennifer and Einie.\nJennifer and Einie will be fine.\nThey'll have no memory\nof this horrible place.\n- What if we don't succeed ?\n- We must succeed.\nThis is heavy, Doc.\nIt's like I was here yesterday.\nYou were here yesterday, Marty.\nAmazing, isn't it ?\nSunrise should be in about 22 minutes.\nYou go into town.\nTrack down young Biff and tail him.\nSometime today, old Biff will show up\nto give young Biff the Almanac.\nAbove all you must not interfere.\nLet old Biff believe he's succeeded\nso he'll leave 1955...\n- and bring the DeLorean to the future.\n- Right.\nOnce old Biff is gone,\ngrab the Almanac anyway that you can.\n- Remember, our futures depend on this.\n- You don't have to remind me of that.\nHere's some binoculars\nand a walkie-talkie to keep in contact.\nI'll stay and repair\nthe short in the time circuit.\nThat way, we don't risk anyone else\nstealing the time machine...\nand I won't risk accidentally\nrunning into my other self.\n- Other self ?\n- Yes. There are now two of me here...\nand there are two of you here.\nThe other me is\nthe Dr. Emmett Brown from 1955.\nThe other me that helps\nthe other you get back to 1985.\nRemember the lightning bolt at the clock\ntower ? That doesn't happen until tonight.\nBe careful not to run into your\nother self. Let me give you some money.\nHave to be prepared\nfor all monetary possibilities.\n- Get yourself some '50s clothes.\n- Check, Doc.\nSomething inconspicuous.\nDoc. Come in. This is Marty. Over.\n- Roger, this is Doc. Are you there ?\n- Yeah, Doc. I'm at the address.\nIt's the only Tannen in the book,\nbut I don't think this is Biff's house.\nIt looks like an old lady lives here.\n- Where are you going, Biff ?\n- I'm going to get my car, Grandma.\nWhen are you coming back ?\nI want you to rub my toes.\nShut up, you old bag.\nGive us our ball back.\n- What ball ?\n- That ball !\nWhat are you talking about ?\nGive us our ball !\nBall ?\n- Is this your ball ?\n- Yeah !\n- You want it back ?\n- Yeah.\nGo get it.\nDoc, it is Biff's house.\nI'm on him. Over.\nShe's all fixed up,\nbut I couldn't get her started.\n- Got a kill switch ?\n- You just need the right touch.\nNobody can start this car but me.\n- The bill comes to $302.57.\n- $300 ?\n$300 for a couple of dents ?\nThat's bullshit.\nIt was horseshit.\nThe whole car was horseshit.\n- Jones wanted $80 to haul it away.\n- I bet he resold it.\n- I got to get something.\n- You want something ?\nYou can call Jones and\nif he wants to give you a refund...\n$300 ! If I catch the guy\nthat caused this I'll break his neck.\nThe manure. I remember that.\n- 4 cans for a $300 job ?\n- I can't have lunch in there.\n- Makes me nauseous.\n- I should get a case for $300.\nIt smells worse than the bathroom.\nThe stench\nis never going to go away, Biff.\nLast time I do you a favor. Last time.\nIt's perfect, Lorraine.\nYou're going to look so good !\nYou're going to look...\nLook at what we have here.\nNice dress, Lorraine.\nAlthough I think you'd look better\nwearing nothing.\n- Take a long walk off a short pier.\n- There's that dance at school tonight.\nNow that my car's fixed...\nI'll give you the honor of going\nwith the best-looking guy in school.\nI'm busy.\n- Doing what ?\n- Washing my hair.\nThat's as funny\nas a screen door on a battleship.\nScreen door on a submarine, you dork.\nBiff, somebody already asked me\nto the dance.\nWho ? That bug George McFly ?\n- I'm going with Calvin Klein, okay ?\n- Calvin Klein ? No, it's not okay.\n- You're going with me, understand ?\n- Get your cooties off me !\nWhen will you get it through your skull ?\nYou're my girl.\nI wouldn't be your girl\neven if you had a million dollars !\nYes, you will !\nIt's you and me, Lorraine.\nWatch it !\nIt's meant to be.\nI'm going to marry you someday, Lorraine.\nSomeday you'll be my wife !\nYou always did have a way with women.\nGet the hell out of my car, old man.\nYou want to marry that girl ?\nI can help make it happen.\n- Who are you, Miss Lonely-hearts ?\n- Just get in the car, butthead.\nWho are you calling butthead, butthead ?\nHow did you do that ?\nNobody can start this car but me.\nGet in the car, Tannen.\nToday's your lucky day.\nWatch where you're driving, old man.\nIf you dent this car, I'll kill you.\n- This cost me $300 !\n- Would you shut up about the car ?\n- How do you know where I live ?\n- Let's just say we're related, Biff.\nThat being the case,\nI got a present for you.\nSomething that'll make you rich.\n- You want to be rich, don't you ?\n- Yeah. Sure. Right. That's rich.\nYou're going to make me rich ?\nYou see this book ?\nThis book tells the future.\nTells the results of every major sports\nevent till the end of this century.\nFootball, baseball, horseraces, boxing.\nThe information in here is worth millions,\nand I'm giving it to you.\nThat's very nice. Thank you very much.\nNow, why don't you make like a tree\nand get out of here ?\nIt's leave, you idiot.\nMake like a tree and leave.\nYou sound like a fool\nwhen you say it wrong.\nAll right, leave.\nAnd take your book with you.\nDon't you get it ?\nYou could make a fortune with this book.\nLet me show you.\nUCLA trails 17-16.\nIt's 4th and 11\nwith only 18 seconds left of this game.\nI'd say it's all over for UCLA.\nBet you a million bucks\nUCLA wins it 19-17.\n- Are you deaf ? It's over. You lost.\n- Yeah ?\nHere comes Decker with the kick.\nIt's up and looks good.\nBall's in the clear.\nField goall UCLA wins 19-17.\nListen to that Coliseum crowd go wild.\nJim Decker...\nAll right. What's the gag ?\nHow did you know what the score would be ?\nI told you, it's in this book.\nAll you got to do is bet on the winner,\nand you'll never lose.\nAll right. I'll take a look at it.\nYou damn fool !\nNever leave this book laying around.\nDon't you have a safe ?\nNo, you don't have a safe.\nGet a safe. Keep it locked up.\nUntil then, keep it on you.\n- What are you doing ?\n- Don't tell anybody, either.\nThere's one more thing.\nOne day, a kid or a crazy old man...\nwho claims to be a scientist\nis going to come around asking...\nI'm trapped.

But it was never love.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was that statement 'It was never love,' which sounded in his ears with madness.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Why must you repeat it so often, that there is no love?' he said in a voice strangled with rage.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Well you don't THINK you love, do you?' she asked.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He was silent with cold passion of anger.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'You don't think you CAN love me, do you?' she repeated almost with a sneer.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'No,' he said.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'You know you never HAVE loved me, don't you?'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'I don't know what you mean by the word 'love,' he replied.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Yes, you do. You know all right that you have never loved me. Have you, do you think?'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'No,' he said, prompted by some barren spirit of truthfulness and obstinacy.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'And you never WILL love me,' she said finally, 'will you?'\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There was a diabolic coldness in her, too much to bear.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'No,' he said.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Then,' she replied, 'what have you against me!'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He was silent in cold, frightened rage and despair. 'If only I could kill her,' his heart was whispering repeatedly. 'If only I could kill her\u2014I should be free.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It seemed to him that death was the only severing of this Gordian knot.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Why do you torture me?' he said.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She flung her arms round his neck.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Ah, I don't want to torture you,' she said pityingly, as if she were comforting a child. The impertinence made his veins go cold, he was insensible. She held her arms round his neck, in a triumph of pity. And her pity for him was as cold as stone, its deepest motive was hate of him, and fear of his power over her, which she must always counterfoil.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Say you love me,' she pleaded. 'Say you will love me for ever\u2014won't you\u2014won't you?'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But it was her voice only that coaxed him. Her senses were entirely apart from him, cold and destructive of him. It was her overbearing WILL that insisted.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Won't you say you'll love me always?' she coaxed. 'Say it, even if it isn't true\u2014say it Gerald, do.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'I will love you always,' he repeated, in real agony, forcing the words out.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She gave him a quick kiss.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Fancy your actually having said it,' she said with a touch of raillery.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He stood as if he had been beaten.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Try to love me a little more, and to want me a little less,' she said, in a half contemptuous, half coaxing tone.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The darkness seemed to be swaying in waves across his mind, great waves of darkness plunging across his mind. It seemed to him he was degraded at the very quick, made of no account.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'You mean you don't want me?' he said.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'You are so insistent, and there is so little grace in you, so little fineness. You are so crude. You break me\u2014you only waste me\u2014it is horrible to me.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Horrible to you?' he repeated.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Yes. Don't you think I might have a room to myself, now Ursula has gone? You can say you want a dressing room.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'You do as you like\u2014you can leave altogether if you like,' he managed to articulate.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Yes, I know that,' she replied. 'So can you. You can leave me whenever you like\u2014without notice even.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The great tides of darkness were swinging across his mind, he could hardly stand upright. A terrible weariness overcame him, he felt he must lie on the floor. Dropping off his clothes, he got into bed, and lay like a man suddenly overcome by drunkenness, the darkness lifting and plunging as if he were lying upon a black, giddy sea. He lay still in this strange, horrific reeling for some time, purely unconscious.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At length she slipped from her own bed and came over to him. He remained rigid, his back to her. He was all but unconscious.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She put her arms round his terrifying, insentient body, and laid her cheek against his hard shoulder.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Gerald,' she whispered. 'Gerald.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There was no change in him. She caught him against her. She pressed her breasts against his shoulders, she kissed his shoulder, through the sleeping jacket. Her mind wondered, over his rigid, unliving body. She was bewildered, and insistent, only her will was set for him to speak to her.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Gerald, my dear!' she whispered, bending over him, kissing his ear.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Her warm breath playing, flying rhythmically over his ear, seemed to relax the tension. She could feel his body gradually relaxing a little, losing its terrifying, unnatural rigidity. Her hands clutched his limbs, his muscles, going over him spasmodically.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The hot blood began to flow again through his veins, his limbs relaxed.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Turn round to me,' she whispered, forlorn with insistence and triumph.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So at last he was given again, warm and flexible. He turned and gathered her in his arms. And feeling her soft against him, so perfectly and wondrously soft and recipient, his arms tightened on her. She was as if crushed, powerless in him. His brain seemed hard and invincible now like a jewel, there was no resisting him.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0His passion was awful to her, tense and ghastly, and impersonal, like a destruction, ultimate. She felt it would kill her. She was being killed.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'My God, my God,' she cried, in anguish, in his embrace, feeling her life being killed within her. And when he was kissing her, soothing her, her breath came slowly, as if she were really spent, dying.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Shall I die, shall I die?' she repeated to herself.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And in the night, and in him, there was no answer to the question.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And yet, next day, the fragment of her which was not destroyed remained intact and hostile, she did not go away, she remained to finish the holiday, admitting nothing. He scarcely ever left her alone, but followed her like a shadow, he was like a doom upon her, a continual 'thou shalt,' 'thou shalt not.' Sometimes it was he who seemed strongest, whist she was almost gone, creeping near the earth like a spent wind; sometimes it was the reverse. But always it was this eternal see-saw, one destroyed that the other might exist, one ratified because the other was nulled.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'In the end,' she said to herself, 'I shall go away from him.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'I can be free of her,' he said to himself in his paroxysms of suffering.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And he set himself to be free. He even prepared to go away, to leave her in the lurch. But for the first time there was a flaw in his will.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Where shall I go?' he asked himself.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Can't you be self-sufficient?' he replied to himself, putting himself upon his pride.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Self-sufficient!' he repeated.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It seemed to him that Gudrun was sufficient unto herself, closed round and completed, like a thing in a case. In the calm, static reason of his soul, he recognised this, and admitted it was her right, to be closed round upon herself, self-complete, without desire. He realised it, he admitted it, it only needed one last effort on his own part, to win for himself the same completeness. He knew that it only needed one convulsion of his will for him to be able to turn upon himself also, to close upon himself as a stone fixes upon itself, and is impervious, self-completed, a thing isolated.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This knowledge threw him into a terrible chaos. Because, however much he might mentally WILL to be immune and self-complete, the desire for this state was lacking, and he could not create it. He could see that, to exist at all, he must be perfectly free of Gudrun, leave her if she wanted to be left, demand nothing of her, have no claim upon her.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But then, to have no claim upon her, he must stand by himself, in sheer nothingness. And his brain turned to nought at the idea. It was a state of nothingness. On the other hand, he might give in, and fawn to her. Or, finally, he might kill her. Or he might become just indifferent, purposeless, dissipated, momentaneous. But his nature was too serious, not gay enough or subtle enough for mocking licentiousness.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A strange rent had been torn in him; like a victim that is torn open and given to the heavens, so he had been torn apart and given to Gudrun. How should he close again? This wound, this strange, infinitely-sensitive opening of his soul, where he was exposed, like an open flower, to all the universe, and in which he was given to his complement, the other, the unknown, this wound, this disclosure, this unfolding of his own covering, leaving him incomplete, limited, unfinished, like an open flower under the sky, this was his cruellest joy. Why then should he forego it? Why should he close up and become impervious, immune, like a partial thing in a sheath, when he had broken forth, like a seed that has germinated, to issue forth in being, embracing the unrealised heavens.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He would keep the unfinished bliss of his own yearning even through the torture she inflicted upon him. A strange obstinacy possessed him. He would not go away from her whatever she said or did. A strange, deathly yearning carried him along with her. She was the determinating influence of his very being, though she treated him with contempt, repeated rebuffs, and denials, still he would never be gone, since in being near her, even, he felt the quickening, the going forth in him, the release, the knowledge of his own limitation and the magic of the promise, as well as the mystery of his own destruction and annihilation.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She tortured the open heart of him even as he turned to her. And she was tortured herself. It may have been her will was stronger. She felt, with horror, as if he tore at the bud of her heart, tore it open, like an irreverent persistent being. Like a boy who pulls off a fly's wings, or tears open a bud to see what is in the flower, he tore at her privacy, at her very life, he would destroy her as an immature bud, torn open, is destroyed.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She might open towards him, a long while hence, in her dreams, when she was a pure spirit. But now she was not to be violated and ruined. She closed against him fiercely.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They climbed together, at evening, up the high slope, to see the sunset. In the finely breathing, keen wind they stood and watched the yellow sun sink in crimson and disappear. Then in the east the peaks and ridges glowed with living rose, incandescent like immortal flowers against a brown-purple sky, a miracle, whilst down below the world was a bluish shadow, and above, like an annunciation, hovered a rosy transport in mid-air.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To her it was so beautiful, it was a delirium, she wanted to gather the glowing, eternal peaks to her breast, and die. He saw them, saw they were beautiful. But there arose no clamour in his breast, only a bitterness that was visionary in itself. He wished the peaks were grey and unbeautiful, so that she should not get her support from them. Why did she betray the two of them so terribly, in embracing the glow of the evening? Why did she leave him standing there, with the ice-wind blowing through his heart, like death, to gratify herself among the rosy snow-tips?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'What does the twilight matter?' he said. 'Why do you grovel before it? Is it so important to you?'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She winced in violation and in fury.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Go away,' she cried, 'and leave me to it. It is beautiful, beautiful,' she sang in strange, rhapsodic tones. 'It is the most beautiful thing I have ever seen in my life. Don't try to come between it and me. Take yourself away, you are out of place\u2014'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He stood back a little, and left her standing there, statue-like, transported into the mystic glowing east. Already the rose was fading, large white stars were flashing out. He waited. He would forego everything but the yearning.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'That was the most perfect thing I have ever seen,' she said in cold, brutal tones, when at last she turned round to him. 'It amazes me that you should want to destroy it. If you can't see it yourself, why try to debar me?' But in reality, he had destroyed it for her, she was straining after a dead effect.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'One day,' he said, softly, looking up at her, 'I shall destroy YOU, as you stand looking at the sunset; because you are such a liar.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There was a soft, voluptuous promise to himself in the words. She was chilled but arrogant.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Ha!' she said. 'I am not afraid of your threats!' She denied herself to him, she kept her room rigidly private to herself. But he waited on, in a curious patience, belonging to his yearning for her.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'In the end,' he said to himself with real voluptuous promise, 'when it reaches that point, I shall do away with her.' And he trembled delicately in every limb, in anticipation, as he trembled in his most violent accesses of passionate approach to her, trembling with too much desire.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She had a curious sort of allegiance with Loerke, all the while, now, something insidious and traitorous. Gerald knew of it. But in the unnatural state of patience, and the unwillingness to harden himself against her, in which he found himself, he took no notice, although her soft kindliness to the other man, whom he hated as a noxious insect, made him shiver again with an access of the strange shuddering that came over him repeatedly.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He left her alone only when he went skiing, a sport he loved, and which she did not practise. The he seemed to sweep out of life, to be a projectile into the beyond. And often, when he went away, she talked to the little German sculptor. They had an invariable topic, in their art.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They were almost of the same ideas. He hated Mestrovic, was not satisfied with the Futurists, he liked the West African wooden figures, the Aztec art, Mexican and Central American. He saw the grotesque, and a curious sort of mechanical motion intoxicated him, a confusion in nature. They had a curious game with each other, Gudrun and Loerke, of infinite suggestivity, strange and leering, as if they had some esoteric understanding of life, that they alone were initiated into the fearful central secrets, that the world dared not know. Their whole correspondence was in a strange, barely comprehensible suggestivity, they kindled themselves at the subtle lust of the Egyptians or the Mexicans. The whole game was one of subtle inter-suggestivity, and they wanted to keep it on the plane of suggestion. From their verbal and physical nuances they got the highest satisfaction in the nerves, from a queer interchange of half-suggested ideas, looks, expressions and gestures, which were quite intolerable, though incomprehensible, to Gerald. He had no terms in which to think of their commerce, his terms were much too gross.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The suggestion of primitive art was their refuge, and the inner mysteries of sensation their object of worship. Art and Life were to them the Reality and the Unreality.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Of course,' said Gudrun, 'life doesn't REALLY matter\u2014it is one's art which is central. What one does in one's life has PEU DE RAPPORT, it doesn't signify much.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Yes, that is so, exactly,' replied the sculptor. 'What one does in one's art, that is the breath of one's being. What one does in one's life, that is a bagatelle for the outsiders to fuss about.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was curious what a sense of elation and freedom Gudrun found in this communication. She felt established for ever. Of course Gerald was BAGATELLE. Love was one of the temporal things in her life, except in so far as she was an artist. She thought of Cleopatra\u2014Cleopatra must have been an artist; she reaped the essential from a man, she harvested the ultimate sensation, and threw away the husk; and Mary Stuart, and the great Rachel, panting with her lovers after the theatre, these were the exoteric exponents of love. After all, what was the lover but fuel for the transport of this subtle knowledge, for a female art, the art of pure, perfect knowledge in sensuous understanding.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One evening Gerald was arguing with Loerke about Italy and Tripoli. The Englishman was in a strange, inflammable state, the German was excited. It was a contest of words, but it meant a conflict of spirit between the two men. And all the while Gudrun could see in Gerald an arrogant English contempt for a foreigner. Although Gerald was quivering, his eyes flashing, his face flushed, in his argument there was a brusqueness, a savage contempt in his manner, that made Gudrun's blood flare up, and made Loerke keen and mortified. For Gerald came down like a sledge-hammer with his assertions, anything the little German said was merely contemptible rubbish.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At last Loerke turned to Gudrun, raising his hands in helpless irony, a shrug of ironical dismissal, something appealing and child-like.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Sehen sie, gnadige Frau-' he began.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Bitte sagen Sie nicht immer, gnadige Frau,' cried Gudrun, her eyes flashing, her cheeks burning. She looked like a vivid Medusa. Her voice was loud and clamorous, the other people in the room were startled.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Please don't call me Mrs Crich,' she cried aloud.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The name, in Loerke's mouth particularly, had been an intolerable humiliation and constraint upon her, these many days.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The two men looked at her in amazement. Gerald went white at the cheek-bones.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'What shall I say, then?' asked Loerke, with soft, mocking insinuation.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Sagen Sie nur nicht das,' she muttered, her cheeks flushed crimson. 'Not that, at least.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She saw, by the dawning look on Loerke's face, that he had understood. She was NOT Mrs Crich! So-o-, that explained a great deal.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Soll ich Fraulein sagen?' he asked, malevolently.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'I am not married,' she said, with some hauteur.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Her heart was fluttering now, beating like a bewildered bird. She knew she had dealt a cruel wound, and she could not bear it.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gerald sat erect, perfectly still, his face pale and calm, like the face of a statue. He was unaware of her, or of Loerke or anybody. He sat perfectly still, in an unalterable calm. Loerke, meanwhile, was crouching and glancing up from under his ducked head.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gudrun was tortured for something to say, to relieve the suspense. She twisted her face in a smile, and glanced knowingly, almost sneering, at Gerald.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Truth is best,' she said to him, with a grimace.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But now again she was under his domination; now, because she had dealt him this blow; because she had destroyed him, and she did not know how he had taken it. She watched him. He was interesting to her. She had lost her interest in Loerke.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gerald rose at length, and went over in a leisurely still movement, to the Professor. The two began a conversation on Goethe.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She was rather piqued by the simplicity of Gerald's demeanour this evening. He did not seem angry or disgusted, only he looked curiously innocent and pure, really beautiful. Sometimes it came upon him, this look of clear distance, and it always fascinated her.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She waited, troubled, throughout the evening. She thought he would avoid her, or give some sign. But he spoke to her simply and unemotionally, as he would to anyone else in the room. A certain peace, an abstraction possessed his soul.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She went to his room, hotly, violently in love with him. He was so beautiful and inaccessible. He kissed her, he was a lover to her. And she had extreme pleasure of him. But he did not come to, he remained remote and candid, unconscious. She wanted to speak to him. But this innocent, beautiful state of unconsciousness that had come upon him prevented her. She felt tormented and dark.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the morning, however, he looked at her with a little aversion, some horror and some hatred darkening into his eyes. She withdrew on to her old ground. But still he would not gather himself together, against her.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Loerke was waiting for her now. The little artist, isolated in his own complete envelope, felt that here at last was a woman from whom he could get something. He was uneasy all the while, waiting to talk with her, subtly contriving to be near her. Her presence filled him with keenness and excitement, he gravitated cunningly towards her, as if she had some unseen force of attraction.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He was not in the least doubtful of himself, as regards Gerald. Gerald was one of the outsiders. Loerke only hated him for being rich and proud and of fine appearance. All these things, however, riches, pride of social standing, handsome physique, were externals. When it came to the relation with a woman such as Gudrun, he, Loerke, had an approach and a power that Gerald never dreamed of.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0How should Gerald hope to satisfy a woman of Gudrun's calibre? Did he think that pride or masterful will or physical strength would help him? Loerke knew a secret beyond these things. The greatest power is the one that is subtle and adjusts itself, not one which blindly attacks. And he, Loerke, had understanding where Gerald was a calf. He, Loerke, could penetrate into depths far out of Gerald's knowledge. Gerald was left behind like a postulant in the ante-room of this temple of mysteries, this woman. But he Loerke, could he not penetrate into the inner darkness, find the spirit of the woman in its inner recess, and wrestle with it there, the central serpent that is coiled at the core of life.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What was it, after all, that a woman wanted? Was it mere social effect, fulfilment of ambition in the social world, in the community of mankind? Was it even a union in love and goodness? Did she want 'goodness'? Who but a fool would accept this of Gudrun? This was but the street view of her wants. Cross the threshold, and you found her completely, completely cynical about the social world and its advantages. Once inside the house of her soul and there was a pungent atmosphere of corrosion, an inflamed darkness of sensation, and a vivid, subtle, critical consciousness, that saw the world distorted, horrific.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What then, what next? Was it sheer blind force of passion that would satisfy her now? Not this, but the subtle thrills of extreme sensation in reduction. It was an unbroken will reacting against her unbroken will in a myriad subtle thrills of reduction, the last subtle activities of analysis and breaking down, carried out in the darkness of her, whilst the outside form, the individual, was utterly unchanged, even sentimental in its poses.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But between two particular people, any two people on earth, the range of pure sensational experience is limited. The climax of sensual reaction, once reached in any direction, is reached finally, there is no going on. There is only repetition possible, or the going apart of the two protagonists, or the subjugating of the one will to the other, or death.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gerald had penetrated all the outer places of Gudrun's soul. He was to her the most crucial instance of the existing world, the NE PLUS ULTRA of the world of man as it existed for her. In him she knew the world, and had done with it. Knowing him finally she was the Alexander seeking new worlds. But there WERE no new worlds, there were no more MEN, there were only creatures, little, ultimate CREATURES like Loerke. The world was finished now, for her. There was only the inner, individual darkness, sensation within the ego, the obscene religious mystery of ultimate reduction, the mystic frictional activities of diabolic reducing down, disintegrating the vital organic body of life.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All this Gudrun knew in her subconsciousness, not in her mind. She knew her next step-she knew what she should move on to, when she left Gerald. She was afraid of Gerald, that he might kill her. But she did not intend to be killed. A fine thread still united her to him. It should not be HER death which broke it. She had further to go, a further, slow exquisite experience to reap, unthinkable subtleties of sensation to know, before she was finished.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of the last series of subtleties, Gerald was not capable. He could not touch the quick of her. But where his ruder blows could not penetrate, the fine, insinuating blade of Loerke's insect-like comprehension could. At least, it was time for her now to pass over to the other, the creature, the final craftsman. She knew that Loerke, in his innermost soul, was detached from everything, for him there was neither heaven nor earth nor hell. He admitted no allegiance, he gave no adherence anywhere. He was single and, by abstraction from the rest, absolute in himself.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whereas in Gerald's soul there still lingered some attachment to the rest, to the whole. And this was his limitation. He was limited, BORNE, subject to his necessity, in the last issue, for goodness, for righteousness, for oneness with the ultimate purpose. That the ultimate purpose might be the perfect and subtle experience of the process of death, the will being kept unimpaired, that was not allowed in him. And this was his limitation.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There was a hovering triumph in Loerke, since Gudrun had denied her marriage with Gerald. The artist seemed to hover like a creature on the wing, waiting to settle. He did not approach Gudrun violently, he was never ill-timed. But carried on by a sure instinct in the complete darkness of his soul, he corresponded mystically with her, imperceptibly, but palpably.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For two days, he talked to her, continued the discussions of art, of life, in which they both found such pleasure. They praised the by-gone things, they took a sentimental, childish delight in the achieved perfections of the past. Particularly they liked the late eighteenth century, the period of Goethe and of Shelley, and Mozart.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They played with the past, and with the great figures of the past, a sort of little game of chess, or marionettes, all to please themselves. They had all the great men for their marionettes, and they two were the God of the show, working it all. As for the future, that they never mentioned except one laughed out some mocking dream of the destruction of the world by a ridiculous catastrophe of man's invention: a man invented such a perfect explosive that it blew the earth in two, and the two halves set off in different directions through space, to the dismay of the inhabitants: or else the people of the world divided into two halves, and each half decided IT was perfect and right, the other half was wrong and must be destroyed; so another end of the world. Or else, Loerke's dream of fear, the world went cold, and snow fell everywhere, and only white creatures, polar-bears, white foxes, and men like awful white snow-birds, persisted in ice cruelty.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Apart from these stories, they never talked of the future. They delighted most either in mocking imaginations of destruction, or in sentimental, fine marionette-shows of the past. It was a sentimental delight to reconstruct the world of Goethe at Weimar, or of Schiller and poverty and faithful love, or to see again Jean Jacques in his quakings, or Voltaire at Ferney, or Frederick the Great reading his own poetry.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They talked together for hours, of literature and sculpture and painting, amusing themselves with Flaxman and Blake and Fuseli, with tenderness, and with Feuerbach and Bocklin. It would take them a life-time, they felt to live again, IN PETTO, the lives of the great artists. But they preferred to stay in the eighteenth and the nineteenth centuries.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They talked in a mixture of languages. The ground-work was French, in either case. But he ended most of his sentences in a stumble of English and a conclusion of German, she skilfully wove herself to her end in whatever phrase came to her. She took a peculiar delight in this conversation. It was full of odd, fantastic expression, of double meanings, of evasions, of suggestive vagueness. It was a real physical pleasure to her to make this thread of conversation out of the different-coloured stands of three languages.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And all the while they two were hovering, hesitating round the flame of some invisible declaration. He wanted it, but was held back by some inevitable reluctance. She wanted it also, but she wanted to put it off, to put it off indefinitely, she still had some pity for Gerald, some connection with him. And the most fatal of all, she had the reminiscent sentimental compassion for herself in connection with him. Because of what HAD been, she felt herself held to him by immortal, invisible threads-because of what HAD been, because of his coming to her that first night, into her own house, in his extremity, because\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gerald was gradually overcome with a revulsion of loathing for Loerke. He did not take the man seriously, he despised him merely, except as he felt in Gudrun's veins the influence of the little creature. It was this that drove Gerald wild, the feeling in Gudrun's veins of Loerke's presence, Loerke's being, flowing dominant through her.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'What makes you so smitten with that little vermin?' he asked, really puzzled. For he, man-like, could not see anything attractive or important AT ALL in Loerke. Gerald expected to find some handsomeness or nobleness, to account for a woman's subjection. But he saw none here, only an insect-like repulsiveness.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gudrun flushed deeply. It was these attacks she would never forgive.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'What do you mean?' she replied. 'My God, what a mercy I am NOT married to you!'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Her voice of flouting and contempt scotched him. He was brought up short. But he recovered himself.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Tell me, only tell me,' he reiterated in a dangerous narrowed voice\u2014'tell me what it is that fascinates you in him.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'I am not fascinated,' she said, with cold repelling innocence.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Yes, you are. You are fascinated by that little dry snake, like a bird gaping ready to fall down its throat.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She looked at him with black fury.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'I don't choose to be discussed by you,' she said.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'It doesn't matter whether you choose or not,' he replied, 'that doesn't alter the fact that you are ready to fall down and kiss the feet of that little insect. And I don't want to prevent you\u2014do it, fall down and kiss his feet. But I want to know, what it is that fascinates you\u2014what is it?'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She was silent, suffused with black rage.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'How DARE you come brow-beating me,' she cried, 'how dare you, you little squire, you bully. What right have you over me, do you think?'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0His face was white and gleaming, she knew by the light in his eyes that she was in his power\u2014the wolf. And because she was in his power, she hated him with a power that she wondered did not kill him. In her will she killed him as he stood, effaced him.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'It is not a question of right,' said Gerald, sitting down on a chair. She watched the change in his body. She saw his clenched, mechanical body moving there like an obsession. Her hatred of him was tinged with fatal contempt.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'It's not a question of my right over you\u2014though I HAVE some right, remember. I want to know, I only want to know what it is that subjugates you to that little scum of a sculptor downstairs, what it is that brings you down like a humble maggot, in worship of him. I want to know what you creep after.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She stood over against the window, listening. Then she turned round.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Do you?' she said, in her most easy, most cutting voice. 'Do you want to know what it is in him? It's because he has some understanding of a woman, because he is not stupid. That's why it is.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A queer, sinister, animal-like smile came over Gerald's face.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'But what understanding is it?' he said. 'The understanding of a flea, a hopping flea with a proboscis. Why should you crawl abject before the understanding of a flea?'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There passed through Gudrun's mind Blake's representation of the soul of a flea. She wanted to fit it to Loerke. Blake was a clown too. But it was necessary to answer Gerald.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Don't you think the understanding of a flea is more interesting than the understanding of a fool?' she asked.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'A fool!' he repeated.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'A fool, a conceited fool\u2014a Dummkopf,' she replied, adding the German word.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Do you call me a fool?' he replied. 'Well, wouldn't I rather be the fool I am, than that flea downstairs?'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She looked at him. A certain blunt, blind stupidity in him palled on her soul, limiting her.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'You give yourself away by that last,' she said.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He sat and wondered.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'I shall go away soon,' he said.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She turned on him.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Remember,' she said, 'I am completely independent of you\u2014completely. You make your arrangements, I make mine.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He pondered this.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'You mean we are strangers from this minute?' he asked.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She halted and flushed. He was putting her in a trap, forcing her hand. She turned round on him.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Strangers,' she said, 'we can never be. But if you WANT to make any movement apart from me, then I wish you to know you are perfectly free to do so. Do not consider me in the slightest.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even so slight an implication that she needed him and was depending on him still was sufficient to rouse his passion. As he sat a change came over his body, the hot, molten stream mounted involuntarily through his veins. He groaned inwardly, under its bondage, but he loved it. He looked at her with clear eyes, waiting for her.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She knew at once, and was shaken with cold revulsion. HOW could he look at her with those clear, warm, waiting eyes, waiting for her, even now? What had been said between them, was it not enough to put them worlds asunder, to freeze them forever apart! And yet he was all transfused and roused, waiting for her.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It confused her. Turning her head aside, she said:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'I shall always TELL you, whenever I am going to make any change\u2014'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And with this she moved out of the room.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He sat suspended in a fine recoil of disappointment, that seemed gradually to be destroying his understanding. But the unconscious state of patience persisted in him. He remained motionless, without thought or knowledge, for a long time. Then he rose, and went downstairs, to play at chess with one of the students. His face was open and clear, with a certain innocent LAISSER-ALLER that troubled Gudrun most, made her almost afraid of him, whilst she disliked him deeply for it.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was after this that Loerke, who had never yet spoken to her personally, began to ask her of her state.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'You are not married at all, are you?' he asked.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She looked full at him.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Not in the least,' she replied, in her measured way. Loerke laughed, wrinkling up his face oddly. There was a thin wisp of his hair straying on his forehead, she noticed that his skin was of a clear brown colour, his hands, his wrists. And his hands seemed closely prehensile. He seemed like topaz, so strangely brownish and pellucid.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Good,' he said.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Still it needed some courage for him to go on.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Was Mrs Birkin your sister?' he asked.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Yes.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'And was SHE married?'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'She was married.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Have you parents, then?'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Yes,' said Gudrun, 'we have parents.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And she told him, briefly, laconically, her position. He watched her closely, curiously all the while.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'So!' he exclaimed, with some surprise. 'And the Herr Crich, is he rich?'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Yes, he is rich, a coal owner.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'How long has your friendship with him lasted?'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Some months.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There was a pause.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Yes, I am surprised,' he said at length. 'The English, I thought they were so\u2014cold. And what do you think to do when you leave here?'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'What do I think to do?' she repeated.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Yes. You cannot go back to the teaching. No\u2014' he shrugged his shoulders\u2014'that is impossible. Leave that to the CANAILLE who can do nothing else. You, for your part\u2014you know, you are a remarkable woman, eine seltsame Frau. Why deny it\u2014why make any question of it? You are an extraordinary woman, why should you follow the ordinary course, the ordinary life?'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gudrun sat looking at her hands, flushed. She was pleased that he said, so simply, that she was a remarkable woman. He would not say that to flatter her\u2014he was far too self-opinionated and objective by nature. He said it as he would say a piece of sculpture was remarkable, because he knew it was so.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And it gratified her to hear it from him. Other people had such a passion to make everything of one degree, of one pattern. In England it was chic to be perfectly ordinary. And it was a relief to her to be acknowledged extraordinary. Then she need not fret about the common standards.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'You see,' she said, 'I have no money whatsoever.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Ach, money!' he cried, lifting his shoulders. 'When one is grown up, money is lying about at one's service. It is only when one is young that it is rare. Take no thought for money\u2014that always lies to hand.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Does it?' she said, laughing.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Always. The Gerald will give you a sum, if you ask him for it\u2014'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She flushed deeply.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'I will ask anybody else,' she said, with some difficulty\u2014'but not him.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Loerke looked closely at her.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Good,' he said. 'Then let it be somebody else. Only don't go back to that England, that school. No, that is stupid.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Again there was a pause. He was afraid to ask her outright to go with him, he was not even quite sure he wanted her; and she was afraid to be asked. He begrudged his own isolation, was VERY chary of sharing his life, even for a day.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'The only other place I know is Paris,' she said, 'and I can't stand that.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She looked with her wide, steady eyes full at Loerke. He lowered his head and averted his face.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Paris, no!' he said. 'Between the RELIGION D'AMOUR, and the latest 'ism, and the new turning to Jesus, one had better ride on a carrousel all day. But come to Dresden. I have a studio there\u2014I can give you work,\u2014oh, that would be easy enough. I haven't seen any of your things, but I believe in you. Come to Dresden\u2014that is a fine town to be in, and as good a life as you can expect of a town. You have everything there, without the foolishness of Paris or the beer of Munich.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He sat and looked at her, coldly. What she liked about him was that he spoke to her simple and flat, as to himself. He was a fellow craftsman, a fellow being to her, first.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'No\u2014Paris,' he resumed, 'it makes me sick. Pah\u2014l'amour. I detest it. L'amour, l'amore, die Liebe\u2014I detest it in every language. Women and love, there is no greater tedium,' he cried.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She was slightly offended. And yet, this was her own basic feeling. Men, and love\u2014there was no greater tedium.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'I think the same,' she said.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'A bore,' he repeated. 'What does it matter whether I wear this hat or another. So love. I needn't wear a hat at all, only for convenience. Neither need I love except for convenience. I tell you what, gnadige Frau\u2014' and he leaned towards her\u2014then he made a quick, odd gesture, as of striking something aside\u2014'gnadige Fraulein, never mind\u2014I tell you what, I would give everything, everything, all your love, for a little companionship in intelligence\u2014' his eyes flickered darkly, evilly at her. 'You understand?' he asked, with a faint smile. 'It wouldn't matter if she were a hundred years old, a thousand\u2014it would be all the same to me, so that she can UNDERSTAND.' He shut his eyes with a little snap.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Again Gudrun was rather offended. Did he not think her good looking, then? Suddenly she laughed.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'I shall have to wait about eighty years to suit you, at that!' she said. 'I am ugly enough, aren't I?'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He looked at her with an artist's sudden, critical, estimating eye.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'You are beautiful,' he said, 'and I am glad of it. But it isn't that\u2014it isn't that,' he cried, with emphasis that flattered her. 'It is that you have a certain wit, it is the kind of understanding. For me, I am little, chetif, insignificant. Good! Do not ask me to be strong and handsome, then. But it is the ME\u2014' he put his fingers to his mouth, oddly\u2014'it is the ME that is looking for a mistress, and my ME is waiting for the THEE of the mistress, for the match to my particular intelligence. You understand?'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Yes,' she said, 'I understand.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'As for the other, this amour\u2014' he made a gesture, dashing his hand aside, as if to dash away something troublesome\u2014'it is unimportant, unimportant. Does it matter, whether I drink white wine this evening, or whether I drink nothing? IT DOES NOT MATTER, it does not matter. So this love, this amour, this BAISER. Yes or no, soit ou soit pas, today, tomorrow, or never, it is all the same, it does not matter\u2014no more than the white wine.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He ended with an odd dropping of the head in a desperate negation. Gudrun watched him steadily. She had gone pale.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Suddenly she stretched over and seized his hand in her own.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'That is true,' she said, in rather a high, vehement voice, 'that is true for me too. It is the understanding that matters.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He looked up at her almost frightened, furtive. Then he nodded, a little sullenly. She let go his hand: he had made not the lightest response. And they sat in silence.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Do you know,' he said, suddenly looking at her with dark, self-important, prophetic eyes, 'your fate and mine, they will run together, till\u2014' and he broke off in a little grimace.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Till when?' she asked, blanched, her lips going white. She was terribly susceptible to these evil prognostications, but he only shook his head.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'I don't know,' he said, 'I don't know.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gerald did not come in from his skiing until nightfall, he missed the coffee and cake that she took at four o'clock. The snow was in perfect condition, he had travelled a long way, by himself, among the snow ridges, on his skis, he had climbed high, so high that he could see over the top of the pass, five miles distant, could see the Marienhutte, the hostel on the crest of the pass, half buried in snow, and over into the deep valley beyond, to the dusk of the pine trees. One could go that way home; but he shuddered with nausea at the thought of home;\u2014one could travel on skis down there, and come to the old imperial road, below the pass. But why come to any road? He revolted at the thought of finding himself in the world again. He must stay up there in the snow forever. He had been happy by himself, high up there alone, travelling swiftly on skis, taking far flights, and skimming past the dark rocks veined with brilliant snow.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But he felt something icy gathering at his heart. This strange mood of patience and innocence which had persisted in him for some days, was passing away, he would be left again a prey to the horrible passions and tortures.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So he came down reluctantly, snow-burned, snow-estranged, to the house in the hollow, between the knuckles of the mountain tops. He saw its lights shining yellow, and he held back, wishing he need not go in, to confront those people, to hear the turmoil of voices and to feel the confusion of other presences. He was isolated as if there were a vacuum round his heart, or a sheath of pure ice.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The moment he saw Gudrun something jolted in his soul. She was looking rather lofty and superb, smiling slowly and graciously to the Germans. A sudden desire leapt in his heart, to kill her. He thought, what a perfect voluptuous fulfilment it would be, to kill her. His mind was absent all the evening, estranged by the snow and his passion. But he kept the idea constant within him, what a perfect voluptuous consummation it would be to strangle her, to strangle every spark of life out of her, till she lay completely inert, soft, relaxed for ever, a soft heap lying dead between his hands, utterly dead. Then he would have had her finally and for ever; there would be such a perfect voluptuous finality.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gudrun was unaware of what he was feeling, he seemed so quiet and amiable, as usual. His amiability even made her feel brutal towards him.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She went into his room when he was partially undressed. She did not notice the curious, glad gleam of pure hatred, with which he looked at her. She stood near the door, with her hand behind her.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'I have been thinking, Gerald,' she said, with an insulting nonchalance, 'that I shall not go back to England.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Oh,' he said, 'where will you go then?'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But she ignored his question. She had her own logical statement to make, and it must be made as she had thought it.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'I can't see the use of going back,' she continued. 'It is over between me and you\u2014'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She paused for him to speak. But he said nothing. He was only talking to himself, saying 'Over, is it? I believe it is over. But it isn't finished. Remember, it isn't finished. We must put some sort of a finish on it. There must be a conclusion, there must be finality.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So he talked to himself, but aloud he said nothing whatever.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'What has been, has been,' she continued. 'There is nothing that I regret. I hope you regret nothing\u2014'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She waited for him to speak.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Oh, I regret nothing,' he said, accommodatingly.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Good then,' she answered, 'good then. Then neither of us cherishes any regrets, which is as it should be.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Quite as it should be,' he said aimlessly.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She paused to gather up her thread again.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Our attempt has been a failure,' she said. 'But we can try again, elsewhere.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A little flicker of rage ran through his blood. It was as if she were rousing him, goading him. Why must she do it?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Attempt at what?' he asked.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'At being lovers, I suppose,' she said, a little baffled, yet so trivial she made it all seem.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Our attempt at being lovers has been a failure?' he repeated aloud.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To himself he was saying, 'I ought to kill her here. There is only this left, for me to kill her.' A heavy, overcharged desire to bring about her death possessed him. She was unaware.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Hasn't it?' she asked. 'Do you think it has been a success?'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Again the insult of the flippant question ran through his blood like a current of fire.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'It had some of the elements of success, our relationship,' he replied. 'It\u2014might have come off.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But he paused before concluding the last phrase. Even as he began the sentence, he did not believe in what he was going to say. He knew it never could have been a success.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'No,' she replied. 'You cannot love.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'And you?' he asked.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Her wide, dark-filled eyes were fixed on him, like two moons of darkness.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'I couldn't love YOU,' she said, with stark cold truth.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A blinding flash went over his brain, his body jolted. His heart had burst into flame. His consciousness was gone into his wrists, into his hands. He was one blind, incontinent desire, to kill her. His wrists were bursting, there would be no satisfaction till his hands had closed on her.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But even before his body swerved forward on her, a sudden, cunning comprehension was expressed on her face, and in a flash she was out of the door. She ran in one flash to her room and locked herself in. She was afraid, but confident. She knew her life trembled on the edge of an abyss. But she was curiously sure of her footing. She knew her cunning could outwit him.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She trembled, as she stood in her room, with excitement and awful exhilaration. She knew she could outwit him. She could depend on her presence of mind, and on her wits. But it was a fight to the death, she knew it now. One slip, and she was lost. She had a strange, tense, exhilarated sickness in her body, as one who is in peril of falling from a great height, but who does not look down, does not admit the fear.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'I will go away the day after tomorrow,' she said.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She only did not want Gerald to think that she was afraid of him, that she was running away because she was afraid of him. She was not afraid of him, fundamentally. She knew it was her safeguard to avoid his physical violence. But even physically she was not afraid of him. She wanted to prove it to him. When she had proved it, that, whatever he was, she was not afraid of him; when she had proved THAT, she could leave him forever. But meanwhile the fight between them, terrible as she knew it to be, was inconclusive. And she wanted to be confident in herself. However many terrors she might have, she would be unafraid, uncowed by him. He could never cow her, nor dominate her, nor have any right over her; this she would maintain until she had proved it. Once it was proved, she was free of him forever.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But she had not proved it yet, neither to him nor to herself. And this was what still bound her to him. She was bound to him, she could not live beyond him. She sat up in bed, closely wrapped up, for many hours, thinking endlessly to herself. It was as if she would never have done weaving the great provision of her thoughts.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'It isn't as if he really loved me,' she said to herself. 'He doesn't. Every woman he comes across he wants to make her in love with him. He doesn't even know that he is doing it. But there he is, before every woman he unfurls his male attractiveness, displays his great desirability, he tries to make every woman think how wonderful it would be to have him for a lover. His very ignoring of the women is part of the game. He is never UNCONSCIOUS of them. He should have been a cockerel, so he could strut before fifty females, all his subjects. But really, his Don Juan does NOT interest me. I could play Dona Juanita a million times better than he plays Juan. He bores me, you know. His maleness bores me. Nothing is so boring, so inherently stupid and stupidly conceited. Really, the fathomless conceit of these men, it is ridiculous\u2014the little strutters.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'They are all alike. Look at Birkin. Built out of the limitation of conceit they are, and nothing else. Really, nothing but their ridiculous limitation and intrinsic insignificance could make them so conceited.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'As for Loerke, there is a thousand times more in him than in a Gerald. Gerald is so limited, there is a dead end to him. He would grind on at the old mills forever. And really, there is no corn between the millstones any more. They grind on and on, when there is nothing to grind\u2014saying the same things, believing the same things, acting the same things. Oh, my God, it would wear out the patience of a stone.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'I don't worship Loerke, but at any rate, he is a free individual. He is not stiff with conceit of his own maleness. He is not grinding dutifully at the old mills. Oh God, when I think of Gerald, and his work\u2014those offices at Beldover, and the mines\u2014it makes my heart sick. What HAVE I to do with it\u2014and him thinking he can be a lover to a woman! One might as well ask it of a self-satisfied lamp-post. These men, with their eternal jobs\u2014and their eternal mills of God that keep on grinding at nothing! It is too boring, just boring. However did I come to take him seriously at all!\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'At least in Dresden, one will have one's back to it all. And there will be amusing things to do. It will be amusing to go to these eurythmic displays, and the German opera, the German theatre. It WILL be amusing to take part in German Bohemian life. And Loerke is an artist, he is a free individual. One will escape from so much, that is the chief thing, escape so much hideous boring repetition of vulgar actions, vulgar phrases, vulgar postures. I don't delude myself that I shall find an elixir of life in Dresden. I know I shan't. But I shall get away from people who have their own homes and their own children and their own acquaintances and their own this and their own that. I shall be among people who DON'T own things and who HAVEN'T got a home and a domestic servant in the background, who haven't got a standing and a status and a degree and a circle of friends of the same. Oh God, the wheels within wheels of people, it makes one's head tick like a clock, with a very madness of dead mechanical monotony and meaninglessness. How I HATE life, how I hate it. How I hate the Geralds, that they can offer one nothing else.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Shortlands!\u2014Heavens! Think of living there, one week, then the next, and THEN THE THIRD\u2014'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'No, I won't think of it\u2014it is too much.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And she broke off, really terrified, really unable to bear any more.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The thought of the mechanical succession of day following day, day following day, AD INFINITUM, was one of the things that made her heart palpitate with a real approach of madness. The terrible bondage of this tick-tack of time, this twitching of the hands of the clock, this eternal repetition of hours and days\u2014oh God, it was too awful to contemplate. And there was no escape from it, no escape.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She almost wished Gerald were with her to save her from the terror of her own thoughts. Oh, how she suffered, lying there alone, confronted by the terrible clock, with its eternal tick-tack. All life, all life resolved itself into this: tick-tack, tick-tack, tick-tack; then the striking of the hour; then the tick-tack, tick-tack, and the twitching of the clock-fingers.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gerald could not save her from it. He, his body, his motion, his life\u2014it was the same ticking, the same twitching across the dial, a horrible mechanical twitching forward over the face of the hours. What were his kisses, his embraces. She could hear their tick-tack, tick-tack.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ha\u2014ha\u2014she laughed to herself, so frightened that she was trying to laugh it off\u2014ha\u2014ha, how maddening it was, to be sure, to be sure!\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then, with a fleeting self-conscious motion, she wondered if she would be very much surprised, on rising in the morning, to realise that her hair had turned white. She had FELT it turning white so often, under the intolerable burden of her thoughts, und her sensations. Yet there it remained, brown as ever, and there she was herself, looking a picture of health.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps she was healthy. Perhaps it was only her unabateable health that left her so exposed to the truth. If she were sickly she would have her illusions, imaginations. As it was, there was no escape. She must always see and know and never escape. She could never escape. There she was, placed before the clock-face of life. And if she turned round as in a railway station, to look at the bookstall, still she could see, with her very spine, she could see the clock, always the great white clock-face. In vain she fluttered the leaves of books, or made statuettes in clay. She knew she was not REALLY reading. She was not REALLY working. She was watching the fingers twitch across the eternal, mechanical, monotonous clock-face of time. She never really lived, she only watched. Indeed, she was like a little, twelve-hour clock, vis-a-vis with the enormous clock of eternity\u2014there she was, like Dignity and Impudence, or Impudence and Dignity.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The picture pleased her. Didn't her face really look like a clock dial\u2014rather roundish and often pale, and impassive. She would have got up to look, in the mirror, but the thought of the sight of her own face, that was like a twelve-hour clock-dial, filled her with such deep terror, that she hastened to think of something else.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Oh, why wasn't somebody kind to her? Why wasn't there somebody who would take her in their arms, and hold her to their breast, and give her rest, pure, deep, healing rest. Oh, why wasn't there somebody to take her in their arms and fold her safe and perfect, for sleep. She wanted so much this perfect enfolded sleep. She lay always so unsheathed in sleep. She would lie always unsheathed in sleep, unrelieved, unsaved. Oh, how could she bear it, this endless unrelief, this eternal unrelief.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gerald! Could he fold her in his arms and sheathe her in sleep? Ha! He needed putting to sleep himself\u2014poor Gerald. That was all he needed. What did he do, he made the burden for her greater, the burden of her sleep was the more intolerable, when he was there. He was an added weariness upon her unripening nights, her unfruitful slumbers. Perhaps he got some repose from her. Perhaps he did. Perhaps this was what he was always dogging her for, like a child that is famished, crying for the breast. Perhaps this was the secret of his passion, his forever unquenched desire for her\u2014that he needed her to put him to sleep, to give him repose.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What then! Was she his mother? Had she asked for a child, whom she must nurse through the nights, for her lover. She despised him, she despised him, she hardened her heart. An infant crying in the night, this Don Juan.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ooh, but how she hated the infant crying in the night. She would murder it gladly. She would stifle it and bury it, as Hetty Sorrell did. No doubt Hetty Sorrell's infant cried in the night\u2014no doubt Arthur Donnithorne's infant would. Ha\u2014the Arthur Donnithornes, the Geralds of this world. So manly by day, yet all the while, such a crying of infants in the night. Let them turn into mechanisms, let them. Let them become instruments, pure machines, pure wills, that work like clock-work, in perpetual repetition. Let them be this, let them be taken up entirely in their work, let them be perfect parts of a great machine, having a slumber of constant repetition. Let Gerald manage his firm. There he would be satisfied, as satisfied as a wheelbarrow that goes backwards and forwards along a plank all day\u2014she had seen it.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The wheel-barrow\u2014the one humble wheel\u2014the unit of the firm. Then the cart, with two wheels; then the truck, with four; then the donkey-engine, with eight, then the winding-engine, with sixteen, and so on, till it came to the miner, with a thousand wheels, and then the electrician, with three thousand, and the underground manager, with twenty thousand, and the general manager with a hundred thousand little wheels working away to complete his make-up, and then Gerald, with a million wheels and cogs and axles.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Poor Gerald, such a lot of little wheels to his make-up! He was more intricate than a chronometer-watch. But oh heavens, what weariness! What weariness, God above! A chronometer-watch\u2014a beetle\u2014her soul fainted with utter ennui, from the thought. So many wheels to count and consider and calculate! Enough, enough\u2014there was an end to man's capacity for complications, even. Or perhaps there was no end.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile Gerald sat in his room, reading. When Gudrun was gone, he was left stupefied with arrested desire. He sat on the side of the bed for an hour, stupefied, little strands of consciousness appearing and reappearing. But he did not move, for a long time he remained inert, his head dropped on his breast.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then he looked up and realised that he was going to bed. He was cold. Soon he was lying down in the dark.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But what he could not bear was the darkness. The solid darkness confronting him drove him mad. So he rose, and made a light. He remained seated for a while, staring in front. He did not think of Gudrun, he did not think of anything.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then suddenly he went downstairs for a book. He had all his life been in terror of the nights that should come, when he could not sleep. He knew that this would be too much for him, to have to face nights of sleeplessness and of horrified watching the hours.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So he sat for hours in bed, like a statue, reading. His mind, hard and acute, read on rapidly, his body understood nothing. In a state of rigid unconsciousness, he read on through the night, till morning, when, weary and disgusted in spirit, disgusted most of all with himself, he slept for two hours.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then he got up, hard and full of energy. Gudrun scarcely spoke to him, except at coffee when she said:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'I shall be leaving tomorrow.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'We will go together as far as Innsbruck, for appearance's sake?' he asked.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Perhaps,' she said.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She said 'Perhaps' between the sips of her coffee. And the sound of her taking her breath in the word, was nauseous to him. He rose quickly to be away from her.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He went and made arrangements for the departure on the morrow. Then, taking some food, he set out for the day on the skis. Perhaps, he said to the Wirt, he would go up to the Marienhutte, perhaps to the village below.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To Gudrun this day was full of a promise like spring. She felt an approaching release, a new fountain of life rising up in her. It gave her pleasure to dawdle through her packing, it gave her pleasure to dip into books, to try on her different garments, to look at herself in the glass. She felt a new lease of life was come upon her, and she was happy like a child, very attractive and beautiful to everybody, with her soft, luxuriant figure, and her happiness. Yet underneath was death itself.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the afternoon she had to go out with Loerke. Her tomorrow was perfectly vague before her. This was what gave her pleasure. She might be going to England with Gerald, she might be going to Dresden with Loerke, she might be going to Munich, to a girl-friend she had there. Anything might come to pass on the morrow. And today was the white, snowy iridescent threshold of all possibility. All possibility\u2014that was the charm to her, the lovely, iridescent, indefinite charm,\u2014pure illusion All possibility\u2014because death was inevitable, and NOTHING was possible but death.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She did not want things to materialise, to take any definite shape. She wanted, suddenly, at one moment of the journey tomorrow, to be wafted into an utterly new course, by some utterly unforeseen event, or motion. So that, although she wanted to go out with Loerke for the last time into the snow, she did not want to be serious or businesslike.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And Loerke was not a serious figure. In his brown velvet cap, that made his head as round as a chestnut, with the brown-velvet flaps loose and wild over his ears, and a wisp of elf-like, thin black hair blowing above his full, elf-like dark eyes, the shiny, transparent brown skin crinkling up into odd grimaces on his small-featured face, he looked an odd little boy-man, a bat. But in his figure, in the greeny loden suit, he looked CHETIF and puny, still strangely different from the rest.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He had taken a little toboggan, for the two of them, and they trudged between the blinding slopes of snow, that burned their now hardening faces, laughing in an endless sequence of quips and jests and polyglot fancies. The fancies were the reality to both of them, they were both so happy, tossing about the little coloured balls of verbal humour and whimsicality. Their natures seemed to sparkle in full interplay, they were enjoying a pure game. And they wanted to keep it on the level of a game, their relationship: SUCH a fine game.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Loerke did not take the toboganning very seriously. He put no fire and intensity into it, as Gerald did. Which pleased Gudrun. She was weary, oh so weary of Gerald's gripped intensity of physical motion. Loerke let the sledge go wildly, and gaily, like a flying leaf, and when, at a bend, he pitched both her and him out into the snow, he only waited for them both to pick themselves up unhurt off the keen white ground, to be laughing and pert as a pixie. She knew he would be making ironical, playful remarks as he wandered in hell\u2014if he were in the humour. And that pleased her immensely. It seemed like a rising above the dreariness of actuality, the monotony of contingencies.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They played till the sun went down, in pure amusement, careless and timeless. Then, as the little sledge twirled riskily to rest at the bottom of the slope,\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Wait!' he said suddenly, and he produced from somewhere a large thermos flask, a packet of Keks, and a bottle of Schnapps.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Oh Loerke,' she cried. 'What an inspiration! What a COMBLE DE JOIE INDEED! What is the Schnapps?'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He looked at it, and laughed.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Heidelbeer!' he said.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'No! From the bilberries under the snow. Doesn't it look as if it were distilled from snow. Can you\u2014' she sniffed, and sniffed at the bottle\u2014'can you smell bilberries? Isn't it wonderful? It is exactly as if one could smell them through the snow.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She stamped her foot lightly on the ground. He kneeled down and whistled, and put his ear to the snow. As he did so his black eyes twinkled up.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Ha! Ha!' she laughed, warmed by the whimsical way in which he mocked at her verbal extravagances. He was always teasing her, mocking her ways. But as he in his mockery was even more absurd than she in her extravagances, what could one do but laugh and feel liberated.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She could feel their voices, hers and his, ringing silvery like bells in the frozen, motionless air of the first twilight. How perfect it was, how VERY perfect it was, this silvery isolation and interplay.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She sipped the hot coffee, whose fragrance flew around them like bees murmuring around flowers, in the snowy air, she drank tiny sips of the Heidelbeerwasser, she ate the cold, sweet, creamy wafers. How good everything was! How perfect everything tasted and smelled and sounded, here in this utter stillness of snow and falling twilight.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'You are going away tomorrow?' his voice came at last.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Yes.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There was a pause, when the evening seemed to rise in its silent, ringing pallor infinitely high, to the infinite which was near at hand.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'WOHIN?'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That was the question\u2014WOHIN? Whither? WOHIN? What a lovely word! She NEVER wanted it answered. Let it chime for ever.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'I don't know,' she said, smiling at him.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He caught the smile from her.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'One never does,' he said.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'One never does,' she repeated.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There was a silence, wherein he ate biscuits rapidly, as a rabbit eats leaves.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'But,' he laughed, 'where will you take a ticket to?'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Oh heaven!' she cried. 'One must take a ticket.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Here was a blow. She saw herself at the wicket, at the railway station. Then a relieving thought came to her. She breathed freely.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'But one needn't go,' she cried.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Certainly not,' he said.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'I mean one needn't go where one's ticket says.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That struck him. One might take a ticket, so as not to travel to the destination it indicated. One might break off, and avoid the destination. A point located. That was an idea!\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Then take a ticket to London,' he said. 'One should never go there.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Right,' she answered.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He poured a little coffee into a tin can.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'You won't tell me where you will go?' he asked.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Really and truly,' she said, 'I don't know. It depends which way the wind blows.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He looked at her quizzically, then he pursed up his lips, like Zephyrus, blowing across the snow.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'It goes towards Germany,' he said.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'I believe so,' she laughed.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Suddenly, they were aware of a vague white figure near them. It was Gerald. Gudrun's heart leapt in sudden terror, profound terror. She rose to her feet.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'They told me where you were,' came Gerald's voice, like a judgment in the whitish air of twilight.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'MARIA! You come like a ghost,' exclaimed Loerke.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gerald did not answer. His presence was unnatural and ghostly to them.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Loerke shook the flask\u2014then he held it inverted over the snow. Only a few brown drops trickled out.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'All gone!' he said.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To Gerald, the smallish, odd figure of the German was distinct and objective, as if seen through field glasses. And he disliked the small figure exceedingly, he wanted it removed.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then Loerke rattled the box which held the biscuits.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Biscuits there are still,' he said.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And reaching from his seated posture in the sledge, he handed them to Gudrun. She fumbled, and took one. He would have held them to Gerald, but Gerald so definitely did not want to be offered a biscuit, that Loerke, rather vaguely, put the box aside. Then he took up the small bottle, and held it to the light.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Also there is some Schnapps,' he said to himself.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then suddenly, he elevated the battle gallantly in the air, a strange, grotesque figure leaning towards Gudrun, and said:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Gnadiges Fraulein,' he said, 'wohl\u2014'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There was a crack, the bottle was flying, Loerke had started back, the three stood quivering in violent emotion.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Loerke turned to Gerald, a devilish leer on his bright-skinned face.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Well done!' he said, in a satirical demoniac frenzy. 'C'est le sport, sans doute.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The next instant he was sitting ludicrously in the snow, Gerald's fist having rung against the side of his head. But Loerke pulled himself together, rose, quivering, looking full at Gerald, his body weak and furtive, but his eyes demoniacal with satire.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Vive le heros, vive\u2014'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But he flinched, as, in a black flash Gerald's fist came upon him, banged into the other side of his head, and sent him aside like a broken straw.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But Gudrun moved forward. She raised her clenched hand high, and brought it down, with a great downward stroke on to the face and on to the breast of Gerald.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A great astonishment burst upon him, as if the air had broken. Wide, wide his soul opened, in wonder, feeling the pain. Then it laughed, turning, with strong hands outstretched, at last to take the apple of his desire. At last he could finish his desire.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He took the throat of Gudrun between his hands, that were hard and indomitably powerful. And her throat was beautifully, so beautifully soft, save that, within, he could feel the slippery chords of her life. And this he crushed, this he could crush. What bliss! Oh what bliss, at last, what satisfaction, at last! The pure zest of satisfaction filled his soul. He was watching the unconsciousness come unto her swollen face, watching the eyes roll back. How ugly she was! What a fulfilment, what a satisfaction! How good this was, oh how good it was, what a God-given gratification, at last! He was unconscious of her fighting and struggling. The struggling was her reciprocal lustful passion in this embrace, the more violent it became, the greater the frenzy of delight, till the zenith was reached, the crisis, the struggle was overborne, her movement became softer, appeased.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Loerke roused himself on the snow, too dazed and hurt to get up. Only his eyes were conscious.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Monsieur!' he said, in his thin, roused voice: 'Quand vous aurez fini\u2014'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A revulsion of contempt and disgust came over Gerald's soul. The disgust went to the very bottom of him, a nausea. Ah, what was he doing, to what depths was he letting himself go! As if he cared about her enough to kill her, to have her life on his hands!\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A weakness ran over his body, a terrible relaxing, a thaw, a decay of strength. Without knowing, he had let go his grip, and Gudrun had fallen to her knees. Must he see, must he know?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A fearful weakness possessed him, his joints were turned to water. He drifted, as on a wind, veered, and went drifting away.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'I didn't want it, really,' was the last confession of disgust in his soul, as he drifted up the slope, weak, finished, only sheering off unconsciously from any further contact. 'I've had enough\u2014I want to go to sleep. I've had enough.' He was sunk under a sense of nausea.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He was weak, but he did not want to rest, he wanted to go on and on, to the end. Never again to stay, till he came to the end, that was all the desire that remained to him. So he drifted on and on, unconscious and weak, not thinking of anything, so long as he could keep in action.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The twilight spread a weird, unearthly light overhead, bluish-rose in colour, the cold blue night sank on the snow. In the valley below, behind, in the great bed of snow, were two small figures: Gudrun dropped on her knees, like one executed, and Loerke sitting propped up near her. That was all.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gerald stumbled on up the slope of snow, in the bluish darkness, always climbing, always unconsciously climbing, weary though he was. On his left was a steep slope with black rocks and fallen masses of rock and veins of snow slashing in and about the blackness of rock, veins of snow slashing vaguely in and about the blackness of rock. Yet there was no sound, all this made no noise.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To add to his difficulty, a small bright moon shone brilliantly just ahead, on the right, a painful brilliant thing that was always there, unremitting, from which there was no escape. He wanted so to come to the end\u2014he had had enough. Yet he did not sleep.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He surged painfully up, sometimes having to cross a slope of black rock, that was blown bare of snow. Here he was afraid of falling, very much afraid of falling. And high up here, on the crest, moved a wind that almost overpowered him with a sleep-heavy iciness. Only it was not here, the end, and he must still go on. His indefinite nausea would not let him stay.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having gained one ridge, he saw the vague shadow of something higher in front. Always higher, always higher. He knew he was following the track towards the summit of the slopes, where was the marienhutte, and the descent on the other side. But he was not really conscious. He only wanted to go on, to go on whilst he could, to move, to keep going, that was all, to keep going, until it was finished. He had lost all his sense of place. And yet in the remaining instinct of life, his feet sought the track where the skis had gone.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He slithered down a sheer snow slope. That frightened him. He had no alpenstock, nothing. But having come safely to rest, he began to walk on, in the illuminated darkness. It was as cold as sleep. He was between two ridges, in a hollow. So he swerved. Should he climb the other ridge, or wander along the hollow? How frail the thread of his being was stretched! He would perhaps climb the ridge. The snow was firm and simple. He went along. There was something standing out of the snow. He approached, with dimmest curiosity.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was a half-buried Crucifix, a little Christ under a little sloping hood, at the top of a pole. He sheered away. Somebody was going to murder him. He had a great dread of being murdered. But it was a dread which stood outside him, like his own ghost.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Yet why be afraid? It was bound to happen. To be murdered! He looked round in terror at the snow, the rocking, pale, shadowy slopes of the upper world. He was bound to be murdered, he could see it. This was the moment when the death was uplifted, and there was no escape.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lord Jesus, was it then bound to be\u2014Lord Jesus! He could feel the blow descending, he knew he was murdered. Vaguely wandering forward, his hands lifted as if to feel what would happen, he was waiting for the moment when he would stop, when it would cease. It was not over yet.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He had come to the hollow basin of snow, surrounded by sheer slopes and precipices, out of which rose a track that brought one to the top of the mountain. But he wandered unconsciously, till he slipped and fell down, and as he fell something broke in his soul, and immediately he went to sleep.Embed",

So baby...\n\n[Chorus]\nWhenever you want me to\nI can make it better\nI just need this one chance to prove it to you\nI can make it better\nAnd oh baby, baby\nDon't be a pawn in his game\nGo 'head and tell him it's over, tell him to go\nOr darling, it's just a shame\n\n[Bridge]\nBetter for you is better for me\nLet's fall in love, and I'll make you see, baby\nBetter for you is better for, better for me, baby\nLet's fall in love, I'll make you, I'll make you see\n[Verse 3]\nNever again will you hear a lie\nNever again will you wanna cry\nNever, oh no, will there be a teardrop in your eye\nStop all this madness in the name of love\nTell him to leave 'cause enough is enough\nLet him go, baby, and you can save your love for me\nTell him you've found somebody\nWho'll give you the love that you just won't believe\n\n[Chorus]\nWhatever you're going through\nI can make it better\nNo one should be making you feel like you do\nI can make it better\nAnd oh baby, baby\nDon't be a link in his chain\nGo 'head and tell him it's over, tell him to go\nOh darling, it's just a shame\n\nIt's better for you, ooh, better for you\n(I can make it better for you)\nBetter for you, so much better for you\n(I can make it better, yeah, babe)\nBetter for you, yeah yeah, better for you\n(I can make it better for you)\nBetter for you, hey, better for you\n(I can make it better, yeah, babe)\nBetter for you, better for you\n(I can make it better for you)\nBetter for you, better for you\n(I can make it better, yeah, babe)Embed",

            "artist": "Warren G Featuring Adina Howard",
            "lyrics": "Well no doubt many of you are wondering why the speaker is so old,\nwell the answer is obviously he hasn\u2019t died yet.\nAnd why was the speaker chosen? Well I don\u2019t know that either. I like to think that the development department had nothing to do with it.\nWhatever the reason I think it\u2019s very fitting that I'm sitting here because I see one crowd of faces in the rear not wearing robes, and I know, from having educated an army of descendants, who really deserves a lot of the honors that are being given are the people here upfront.\nThe sacrifice and the wisdom and the value transfer that comes from one generation to the next can never be underrated.\nAnd that gives me enormous pleasure as I look at this sea of Asian faces to my left.\nAll my life I\u2019ve admired Confucius. I like the idea of filial piety, the idea that there are values that are taught and duties that come naturally and all that should be passed on to the next generation.\nAnd you people who don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything in this idea, please note how fast these Asian faces are rising in American life.\nI think they have something.\n\nAll right, I scratched out a few notes and I\u2019m going to try and just give an account of some ideas and attitudes that have worked well for me.\nI don\u2019t claim that they are perfect for everybody.\nAlthough I think many of them are pretty close to Universal values and many of them are can\u2019t fail ideas.\nWhat are the core ideas that have helped me?\nWell luckily I got at a very early age, the idea that the safest way to try and get what you want, is to try and deserve what you want.\nIt\u2019s such a simple idea, it\u2019s the golden rule so to speak.\nYou want to deliver to the world what you would buy if you were on the other end.\nThere is no ethos in my opinion, that is better for any lawyer or any other person to have.\nBy and large the people who have this ethos win in life and they don\u2019t win just money, just honors emoluments.\nThey win the respect, the deserved trust, of the people they deal with, and there is huge pleasure in life to be obtained from getting deserved trust.\nAnd so the way to get it is to deliver what you\u2019d want to buy if the circumstances were reversed.\nOccasionally you find a perfect rogue of a person, who dies rich and widely known.\nBut mostly these people are fully understood by the surrounding civilization, and when the cathedral is full of people at the funeral ceremony, most of them are there to celebrate the fact that the person is dead.\nAnd, that reminds me of the story of the time when one of these people died and the minister said, \u201cit\u2019s now time for someone to say something nice about the deceased\u201d.\nAnd nobody came forward.\nAnd nobody came forward.\nAnd nobody came forward.\nAnd finally one man came up and he said, \u201cwell, his brother was worse\u201d.\nThat is not where you want to go! That\u2019s not the kind of funeral you want to have you'll leave entirely the wrong example.\nA second idea that I got very early was that there is no love that\u2019s so right as admiration based love, and that love should include the instructive dead.\nSomehow I got that idea and I lived with it all my life and it\u2019s been very very useful to me.\nA love like that celebrated by Somerset Maugham and his book \u201cOf Human Bondage\u201d that\u2019s a sick kind of love, it\u2019s a disease. And if you find yourself in a disease like that my advice to you is turn around and fix it. Eliminate it.\nAnother idea that I got and this may remind you of Confucius too, is that wisdom acquisition is a moral duty, it\u2019s not something you do just to advance in life. Wisdom acquisition is a moral duty.\nAnd there\u2019s a corollary to that proposition which is very important, it means that you\u2019re hooked for lifetime learning, and without lifetime learning you people are not going to do very well.\nYou are not going to get very far in life based on what you already know.\nYou\u2019re going to advance in life by what you\u2019re going to learn after you leave here.\nIf you take Berkshire Hathaway which is certainly one of the best regarded corporations in the world and may have the best long-term investment record in the entire history of civilization. The skill that got Berkshire through one decade would not have sufficed to get it through the next decade with the achievements made.\nWithout Warren Buffett being a learning machine, a continuous learning machine, the record would have been absolutely impossible.\nThe same is true at lower walks of life. I constantly see people rise in life who are not the smartest, sometimes not even the most diligent, but they are learning machines, they go to bed every night a little wiser than when they got up and boy does that help particularly when you have a long run ahead of you.\nAlfred North Whitehead said it one time that \u201cthe rapid advance of civilization came only when man invented the method of invention\u201d, and of course he was referring to the huge growth of GDP per capita and all the other good things that we now take for granted which started a few hundred years ago and before that all was stasis.\nSo if civilization can progress only when it invents the method of invention, you can progress only when you learn the method of learning.\nI was very lucky. I came to law school having learned the method of learning and nothing has served me better in my long life than continuous learning.\nAnd if you take Warren Buffett and watched him with a time clock, I would say half of all the time he spends is sitting on his ass and reading. And a big chunk of the rest of the time is spent talking one on one either on the telephone or personally with highly gifted people whom he trusts and who trust him.\nIn other words it looks quite academic all this worldly success.\n\nAcademia has many wonderful values in it. I came across such a value not too long ago. It was several years ago.\nIn my capacity as a hospital board chairman I was dealing with a medical school academic. And this man over years of hard work had made himself know more about bone tumor pathology than almost anybody else in the world. And he wanted to pass this knowledge on to the rest of us.\nAnd how was he going to do it? Well he decided to write a textbook that would be very useful to other people.\nAnd I don\u2019t think a textbook like this sells two thousand copies if those two thousand copies are in all the major cancer centers in the world.\nHe took a year sabbatical, he sat down in his computer and he had all the slides because he saved them and organized them and filed them. He worked 17 hours a day, 7 days a week, for a year and that was his sabbatical. At the end of the year he had one of the great bone tumor pathology textbooks in the world.\nWhen you\u2019re around values like that, you want to pick up as much as you can.\n\nAnother idea that was hugely useful to me was that I listened in law school when some wag said, \u201cA legal mind is a mind that when two things are all twisted up together and interacting, it's feasible to think responsibly about one thing and not the other.\"\nWell I could see from that one sentence that that was perfectly ridiculous, and it pushed me further into my natural drift, which was into learning all the big ideas and all the big disciplines. So I wouldn\u2019t be a perfect damn fool who was trying to think about one aspect of something that couldn\u2019t be removed from the totality of the situation in a constructive fashion.\nAnd what I noted since the really big ideas carry 95% of the freight, it wasn\u2019t at all hard for me to pick up all the big ideas and all the big disciplines and make them a standard part of my mental routines.\nOnce you have the ideas of course they are no good if you don\u2019t practice. You don\u2019t practice you lose it.\nSo I went through life constantly practicing this model of disciplinary approach. Well I can\u2019t tell you what that\u2019s done for me, it\u2019s made life more fun, it\u2019s made me more constructive, it\u2019s made me more helpful to others, it\u2019s made me enormously rich, you name it, that attitude really helps.\nNow there are dangers there, because it works so well, that if you do it, you will frequently find you are sitting in the presence of some other expert, maybe even an expert that\u2019s superior to you, supervising you. And you will know more than he does about his own specialty, a lot more. You will see the correct answer when he\u2019s missed it.\nThat is a very dangerous position to be in. You can cause enormous offense by helpfully being right in a way that causes somebody else to lose face. And I never found a perfect way to solve that problem.\nI was a great poker player when I was young but I wasn\u2019t a good enough poker player so people failed to sense that I thought I knew more than they did about their subjects and it gave a lot of offense. Now I\u2019m just regarded as eccentric but it was a difficult period to go through.\nAnd my advice to you is to learn sometimes to keep your light under a bushel.\nOne of my colleagues, also number one in his class in law school, a great success in life worked for the supreme court etc\u2026 He knew a lot and he tended to show it as a very young lawyer and one day the senior partner called him in and said, \u201clisten Chuck, I want to explain something to you. Your duty under any circumstances is to behave in such a way that the client thinks he\u2019s the smartest person in the world. If you have any little energy and insight available after that, use it to make your senior partner look like the smartest person in the world. And only after you\u2019ve satisfied those two obligations do you want your light to shine at all\u201d.\nWell, that may be very good advice for rising in a large firm. It wasn\u2019t what I did I always obeyed the drift of my nature and if other people didn\u2019t like it I didn\u2019t need to be adored by everybody.\nAnother idea, and by the way when I talk about this multidisciplinary attitude I\u2019m really following a very key idea of the greatest lawyer of antiquity, Marcus Tullius Cicero.\nCicero is famous for saying, \u201ca man who doesn\u2019t know what happened before he was born goes through life like a child\u201d. That is a very correct idea of Cicero\u2019s. And he\u2019s right to ridicule somebody so foolish as not to  know what happened before he was born.\nBut if you generalize Cicero as I think one should, there are all these other things that you should know in addition to history and those other things are the big ideas in all the other disciplines. And it doesn\u2019t help you just to know them enough just so you can prattle them back down on an exam and get an A. You have to learn these things in such a way that they\u2019re in a mental latticework in your head and you automatically use them for the rest of your life.\nIf you do that I solemnly promise you that one day you\u2019ll be walking down the street and look to your right and left and think, \u201cmy heavenly days! I\u2019m now one of the few most competent people of my whole age forward.\"\nIf you don\u2019t do it, many of the brightest of you will live in the middle ranks or in the shallows.\n\nAnother idea that I got, and it was encapsulated by that story the Dean recounted about the man who wanted to know where he was going to die and he wouldn\u2019t go there, that rustic let that idea have a profound truth in his hand.\nThe way complex adaptive systems work and the way mental constructs work; problems frequently get easier and I would even say usually are easier to solve if you turn around in reverse.\nIn other words if you want to help India, the question you should ask is not \u201chow can I help India?\u201d, you think \u201cwhat\u2019s doing the worst damage in India? What would automatically do the worst damage and how do I avoid it?\"\nYou\u2019d think they are logically the same thing, they\u2019re not.\nThose of you who have mastered algebra know that inversion frequently will solve problems which nothing else will solve.\nAnd in life, unless you\u2019re more gifted than Einstein, inversion will help you solve problems that you can't solve in other ways.\nBut to use a little inversion now, what will really fail in life? What do you want to avoid? Such an easy answer;\nsloth and unreliability.\nIf you\u2019re unreliable it doesn\u2019t matter what your virtues are, you\u2019re going to crater immediately.\nSo doing what you have faithfully engaged to do should be an automatic part of your conduct. You want to avoid sloth and unreliability.\n\nAnother thing I think should be avoided is extremely intense ideology because it cabbages up one\u2019s mind.\nYou\u2019ve seen that. You see a lot of it on TV you know preachers for instance, you know they\u2019ve all got different ideas about theology and a lot of them have minds that are made of cabbage.\nBut that can happen with political ideology. And if you're young it\u2019s easy to drift in to loyalties and when you announce that you\u2019re a loyal member and you start shouting the orthodox ideology out what you\u2019re doing is pounding it in, pounding it in and you\u2019re gradually ruining your mind so you want to be very careful with this ideology. It\u2019s a big danger.\nIn my mind I got a little example I use whenever I think about ideology and it\u2019s these Scandinavian canoeists who succeeded in taming all the rapids of Scandinavia and they thought they would tackle the whirlpools in the Aaron Rapids here in the United States. The death rate was 100%.\nA big whirlpool is not something you want to go into and I think the same is true about a really deep ideology.\nI have what I call an iron prescription that helps me keep sane when I naturally drift toward preferring one ideology over another. And that is I say \u201cI\u2019m not entitled to have an opinion on this subject unless I can state the arguments against my position better than the people do who are supporting it. I think only when I reach that stage am I qualified to speak.\u201d\nNow you can say that\u2019s too much of an iron discipline, it\u2019s not too much of an iron discipline, it\u2019s not even that hard to do. It sounds a lot like the iron prescription of Ferdinand the Great, \u201cit\u2019s not necessary to hope in order to persevere.\"\nThat probably is too tough for most people, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too tough for me but it's too tough for most people.\nBut this business of not drifting into extreme ideology is a very very important thing in life if you want to have more correct knowledge and be wiser than other people. A heavy ideology is very likely to do you in.\nAnother thing of course that does one in is the self serving bias to which we are all subject.\nYou think that your little me is entitled to do what it wants to do, and for instance why shouldn\u2019t the true little me overspend my income?\nWell, there once was a man who became the most famous composer in the world but he was utterly miserable most of the time and one of the reasons was he always overspent his income, that was Mozart.\nIf Mozart can\u2019t get by with this kind of asinine conduct, I don\u2019t think you should try it.\n\nGenerally speaking, envy, resentment, revenge and self pity are disastrous modes of thought, self-pity gets pretty close to paranoia, and paranoia is one of the very hardest things to reverse, you do not want to drift into self-pity.\nI have a friend who carried a big stack of linen cards about this thick, and when somebody would make a comment that reflected self pity, he would take out one of the cards, take the top one off the stack and hand it to the person, and the card said, \u201cyour story has touched my heart, never have I heard of anyone with as many misfortunes as you\u201d. Well you can say that\u2019s waggery, but I suggest that every time you find you\u2019re drifting into self pity, I don\u2019t care what the cause your child could be dying of cancer, self-pity is not going to improve the situation, just give yourself one of those cards.\nIt\u2019s a ridiculous way to behave, and when you avoid it you get a great advantage over everybody else, almost everybody else, because self-pity is a standard condition and yet you can train yourself out of it.\nAnd of course a self serving bias, you want to get out of yourself, thinking that what\u2019s good for you is good for the wider civilization and rationalizing all these ridiculous conclusions based on the subconscious tendency to serve one\u2019s self.\nIt\u2019s a terribly inaccurate way to think and of course you want to drive that out of yourself because you want to be wise not foolish.\nYou also have to allow for the self serving bias of everybody else, because most people are not gonna remove it all that successfully, the only condition being what it is. If you don\u2019t allow for self serving bias in your conduct, again you\u2019re a fool.\nI watched the brilliant Harvard law Review trained general counsel of *unclear* lose his career, and what he did was when the CEO was aware some underling has done something wrong the general counsel said \u201cgee we don\u2019t have any legal duty to report this but I think it\u2019s what we should do it\u2019s our moral duty.\"\nOf course the general counsel was totally correct but of course it didn\u2019t work it was a very unpleasant thing for the CEO to do and he put it off and put if off and of course everything erode into a major scandal and down went the CEO and the general counsel with him.\nThe correct answer in situations like that was given by Ben Franklin, he said \u201cif you want to persuade appeal to interest not to reason.\u201d The self serving bias is so extreme.\nIf the general counsel said, \u201clook this is going to erupt, it\u2019s something that will destroy you take away your money, take away your status it\u2019s a perfect disaster\u201d, it would have worked!\nYou want to appeal to interest, you want to do it of lofty motives, but you should not avoid appealing to interest.\n\nAnother thing, perverse incentives. You don\u2019t want to be in a perverse incentive system that\u2019s causing you to behave more and more foolishly or worse and worse.\nIncentives are too powerful a controller of human cognition and human behavior and one of the things you are going to find in some modern law firms is billable hour quotas and I could not have lived under a billable hour quota of 2,400 hours a year. That would have caused serious problems for me I wouldn\u2019t have done it and I don\u2019t have a solution for you for that you have to figure it out for yourself but it\u2019s a significant problem.\n\nPerverse associations, also to be avoided. You particularly want to avoid working directly under somebody you really don\u2019t admire and don\u2019t want to be like.\nIt\u2019s very dangerous we are all subject to control to some extent our authority figures strictly authority figures that are rewarding us.\nAnd that requires some talent, the way I solved that is I figured out the people I did admire and I maneuvered cleverly without criticizing anybody so I was working entirely under people I admired. And a lot of law firms will permit that if you\u2019re shrewd enough to work it out and your outcome in life will be way more satisfactory and way better if you work under people you really admire, the alternative is not a good idea.\n\nObjectivity maintenance.\nWell we all remember that Darwin paid special attention to disconfirming evidence particularly to disconfirm something he believed and loved.\nWell objectivity maintenance routines are totally required in life if you\u2019re going to be a correct thinker. And they were talking about Darwin\u2019s attitude, special attention to the disconfirming evidence, and also to checklist routines.\nChecklist routines avoid a lot of errors. You should have all this elementary wisdom and then you should go through and have a checklist in order to use it. There is no other procedure that will work as well.\n\nA last idea that I found very important is I realized very early that non-egality would work better in the parts of the world I wanted to inhabit. What do I mean by non-egality? I mean John Wood when he was the number one basketball coach in the world, he just said to the bottom five players, \u201cyou don\u2019t get to play your spurring partners\u201d, the top seven did the whole playing. Well the top seven learned more, remember the learning machine, because they were doing all the playing. And when he got to that system Wood won more than he\u2019d ever won before.\nI think the game of life in many respects is getting a lot of practice into the hands of the people that have the most aptitude to learn and the most tendency to be learning machines. And if you want the very highest reaches of human civilization that\u2019s where you have to go.\nYou do not want to choose a brain surgeon for your child among fifty applicants all of them just take turns during the procedure.\nYou don\u2019t want your airplanes designed that way.\nYou don\u2019t want your Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s run that way.\nYou want to get the power into the right people.\nI frequently tell the story of Max Planck when he won the Nobel prize and went around Germany giving lectures on quantum mechanics, and the chauffeur gradually memorized the lecture and he said, \u201cwould you mind professor Planck just, it\u2019s so boring staying on our routines, would you mind if I gave the lecture this time and you just sat in front with my chauffeur\u2019s hat?\u201d And Planck said sure.\nAnd the chauffeur got up and gave this long lecture on quantum mechanics after which a physics professor stood up in the rear and asked a perfectly ghastly question and the chauffeur said, \u201cwell I\u2019m surprised that in an advanced city like Munich I get such an elementary question, I\u2019m going to ask my chauffeur to reply.\"\nWell the reason I tell that story is not entirely to celebrate the quick wittiness of the protagonist.\nIn this world we have two kinds of knowledge, one is Planck knowledge, the people who really know, they paid the dues they have the aptitude.\nThen we got chauffeur knowledge, they have learned to prattle the talk. They have a big head of hair, they have a fine temper in the voice, they make a hell of an impression, but in the end they've got chauffeur knowledge\u2026 I think I\u2019ve just described practically every politician in the United States.\nAnd you are gonna have the problem in your life of getting the responsibility into the people of the Planck knowledge in a way for the people who have the chauffeur knowledge, and there are huge forces working against you.\nMy generation has failed you to some extent. We are delivering to you in California a legislature where only the certified nuts from the left and the certified nuts from the right are allowed to serve and none of them are removable.\nThat\u2019s what my generation has done for you, but you wouldn\u2019t like it to be too easy would you?\n\nAnother thing that I found is an intense interest of the subject is indispensable if you are really going to excel. I could force myself to be fairly good in a lot of things, but I couldn\u2019t be really good in anything where I didn\u2019t have an intense interest, so to some extent you\u2019re going to have to follow me.\nIf at all feasible you want to drift into doing something in which you really have a natural interest.\n\nAnother thing you have to do of course is have a lot of assiduity. I like that word because it means sit down in your ass until you do it.\nI\u2019ve had marvelous partners all my life. I think I got them partly because I tried to deserve them and partly because I was wise enough to select them and partly maybe it was some luck.\nBut two partners that I chose for one little phase of my life had the following rule and they created a little designed build, construction team. And they sat down and said, 2 man partnership, divide everything equally, here\u2019s the rule; \u201cwhenever we're behind in our commitments to other people we will both work 14 hours a day until we caught up.\"\nWell needless to say that firm didn\u2019t fail! The people died rich. It\u2019s such a simple idea.\n\nAnother thing of course is life will have terrible blows, horrible blows, unfair blows, doesn\u2019t matter. And some people recover and others don\u2019t. And there I think the attitude of Epictetus is the best. He thought that every mischance in life was an opportunity to behave well, every mischance in life was an opportunity to learn something and your duty was not to be submerged in self-pity but to  utilize the terrible blow in a constructive fashion. That is a very good idea.\nYou may remember the epitaph which Epictetus left for himself, \u201cHere lies Epictetus, a slave maimed in body, the ultimate in poverty, and favored of the gods\u201d.\nWell that\u2019s the way Epictetus is now remembered. He said big consequences. And he was favorite of the Gods! He was favored because he became wise, and he became manly. Very good idea.\n\nI got a final little idea because I\u2019m all for prudence as well as opportunism.\nMy grandfather was the only federal judge in his city for nearly forty years and I really admired him. I\u2019m his namesake.\nAnd I\u2019m Confucian enough that even now I sit here and I\u2019m saying, \u201cwell, Judge Munger would be pleased to see me here.\"\nSo I\u2019m Confucian enough all these years after my grandfather is dead to carry the torch for my grandfather\u2019s values.\nAnd grandfather Munger was a federal judge at the time and there were no pensions for widows of federal judges so if he didn\u2019t save from his income my grandmother would have been in penury. And being the kind of man he was he underspent his income all his life and left her in comfortable circumstances.\nAlong the way in the thirties my uncle\u2019s bank failed and couldn\u2019t reopen and my grandfather saved the bank by taking over a third of his assets, good assets, and putting them into the bank and taking up horrible assets in exchange.\nAnd of course it did save the bank and while my grandfather took a loss he got most of his money back eventually.\nBut I\u2019ve always remembered the example. And so when I got to college and I came across Houseman, I remember the little poem from Houseman that went something like this:\n\n\u201cThe thoughts of others\nwere light and fleeting,\nof lovers' meeting\nLuck or fame.\nMine were of trouble,\nAnd mine were steady,\nAnd I was ready\nWhen trouble came.\"\n\nYou can say, \u201cwho wants to go through life anticipating trouble?\u201d. Well I did! All my life I\u2019ve gone through life anticipating trouble and here I am well along on my 84th year and like Epictetus I\u2019ve had a favored life.\nIt didn't make me unhappy to anticipate trouble all the time and be ready to perform adequately if trouble came. It didn\u2019t hurt me at all. In fact it helped me. So I quick claim to you Houseman and Judge Munger.\n\nThe last idea that I want to give you as you go out into a profession that frequently puts a lot of procedure and a lot of precautions and a lot of mumbo jumbo into what it does, this is not a fast form which civilization can reach. A fast form which civilization can reach is a seamless web of deserved trust. Not much procedure just totally reliable people correctly trusting one another. That\u2019s the way an operating room works at the Mayo clinic.\nIf a bunch of lawyers were to introduce a lot of process, the patients would all die.\nSo never forget when you\u2019re a lawyer that you may be rewarded for selling this stuff but you don\u2019t have to buy it.\nIn your own life what you want is a seamless web of deserved trust. And if your proposed marriage contract has 47 pages my suggestion is do not enter.\n\nWell that\u2019s enough for one graduation.\nI hope these ruminations of an old man are useful to you. In the end I\u2019m like the Old Valiant-for-Truth in The Pilgrim\u2019s Progress;\n\u201cMy sword I leave to him who can wear it.\"2Embed",
