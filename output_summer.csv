I got my driver's license last week
Just like we always talked about
'Cause you were so excited for me
To finally drive up to your house
But today, I drove through the suburbs
Crying 'cause you weren't around

[Verse 2]
And you're probably with that blonde girl
Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?

[Chorus]
And I know we weren't perfect, but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

[Verse 3]
And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you, but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
And pictured I was driving home to you

Can't drive past the places we used to go to
'Cause I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
Sidewalks we crossed
I still hear your voice in the traffic, we're laughing
Over all the noise
God, I'm so blue, know we're through
But I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)

2021,Brutal,Olivia Rodrigo,"[Intro]
I want it to be, like, messy

[Verse 1]
I'm so insecure, I think
That I'll die before I drink
And I'm so caught up in the news
Of who likes me and who hates you
And I'm so tired that I might
Quit my job, start a new life
And they'd all be so disappointed
'Cause who am I if not exploited?
And I'm so sick of seventeen
Where's my fucking teenage dream?
If someone tells me one more time
""Enjoy your youth,"" I'm gonna cry
And I don't stick up for myself
I'm anxious, and nothing can help
And I wish I'd done this before
And I wish people liked me more

[Chorus]
All I did was try my best
This the kinda thanks I get?
Unrelentlessly upset (Ah-ah-ah)

And I hate the way I'm perceived

And lately, I'm a nervous wreck
'Cause I love people I don't like
And I hate every song I write
And I'm not cool, and I'm not smart
And I can't even parallel park

2021,Enough For You,Olivia Rodrigo,"[Verse 1]
I wore makeup when we dated
'Cause I thought you'd like me more
If I looked like the other prom queens
I know that you loved before
Tried so hard to be everything that you liked
Just for you to say you're not the compliment type

[Verse 2]
And I knew how you took your coffee
And your favorite songs by heart
I read all of your self-help books
So you'd think that I was smart
Stupid, emotional, obsessive little me
I knew from the start this is exactly how you'd leave

[Chorus]
You found someonе more exciting, the nеxt second, you were gone
And you left me there cryin', wonderin' what I did wrong
And you always say I'm never satisfied, but I don't think that's true
'Cause all I ever wanted was to be enough for you
Yeah, all I ever wanted was to be enough for you

[Verse 3]
And maybe I'm just not as interesting
As the girls you had before
But God, you couldn't have cared less
About someone who loved you more
I'd say you broke my heart
But you broke much more than that
Now, I don't want your sympathy
I just want myself back

We broke up a month ago
Your friends are mine, you know I know
You've moved on, found someone new
One more girl who brings out the better in you
And I thought my heart was detached
From all the sunlight of our past
But she's so sweet, she's so pretty
Does she mean you forgot about me?

Oh, I hope you're happy
But not like how you were with me

So find someone great, but don't find no one better
I hope you're happy, but don't be happier

And do you tell her she's the most beautiful girl you've ever seen?
An eternal love bullshit you know you'll never mean
Remember when I believed
You meant it when you said it first to me?
And now I'm pickin' her apart
Like cuttin' her down will make you miss my wretched heart

[Verse 1]
I've been tryna call
I've been on my own for long enough
Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
I'm goin' through withdrawals
You don't even have to do too much
You can turn me on with just a touch, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
I look around and
Sin City's cold and empty (Oh)
No one's around to judge me (Oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone

[Chorus]
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
Hey, hey, hey

I'm running out of time
'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky

2021,Beautiful Mistakes,Maroon 5 Featuring Megan Thee Stallion,"[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
It's beautiful, it's bittersweet
You're like a broken home to me
I take a shot of memories
And black out like an empty street
I fill my days with the way you walk
And fill my nights with broken dreams
I make up lies inside my head
Like one day, you'll come back to me

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Now I'm not holdin' on, not holdin' on
I'm just depressed that you're gone
Not holdin' on, not holdin' on

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Beautiful mistakes
I make inside my head
She's naked in my bed
And now we lie awake
Makin' beautiful mistakes
I wouldn't take 'еm back
I'm in love with the past
And now we liе awake
Makin' beautiful mistakes

It's pitiful, I can't believe
How every day gets worse for me
I take a break, I cut you off
To keep myself from lookin' soft
I fill my nights with the way you was
And still wake up with broken dreams
I make these lies inside my head
Feel like they're my reality

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Now I'm not holdin' on, not holdin' on
I'm just depressed that you're gone

Doin' somethin' different, got me lookin' stupid (Damn)
The only way I'm comin' back to you is if you dreamin' lucid (Hmm)
Prove it, if you made a promise then keep it (Keep it)
Why you wanna lie and then get mad? I don't believe it (Boy, bye)
But really, I was doin' just fine without ya
Lookin' fine, sippin' wine, dancin' on club couches (Ah)
Baby, why you wanna lose me like you don't need me? (Don't need me)
Like I don't block you and you still try to reach me (Still try to reach me)
How you figure out how to call me from the TV? (Huh?)
You runnin' outta chances and this time I mean it (Ah)

[Bridge: Megan Thee Stallion]
Yeah, bet you miss my love, all in your bed (Bed)
Now you're stressin' out, pullin' your hair (Hair)
Smellin' your pillows and wishin' I was there (I was there)
Slidin' down the shower wall, lookin' sad (Sad)
I know it's hard to let go, I'm the best (I'm the best)
Best you ever had and best you gon' get (Gon' get)
And if we break up, I don't wanna be friends (Be friends)
You're toxic

I knew a boy once when I was small
A towhead blond with eyes of salt
He played the drum in the marching band
His parents cared more about the Bible
Than being good to their own child
He wore long sleeves 'cause of his dad
And somehow, we fell out of touch
Hope he took his bad deal and made a royal flush
Don't know if I'll see you again someday
But if you're out there, I hope that you're okay

[Verse 2]
My middle school friend grew up alone
She raised her brothers on hеr own
Her parents hated who shе loved
She couldn't wait to go to college
She was tired 'cause she was brought into a world
Where family was merely blood
Does she know how proud I am she was created
With the courage to unlearn all of their hatred?
We don't talk much, but I just gotta say
I miss you and I hope that you're okay

And the monsters creep into your house

Yeah, I kinda put the cup down for a minute but umm
But honestly, it ain't nobody's business what's in my cup, what's in your cup, what's in they cup
It's your cup, drink it
So whatever the hell was in my cup, the only reaction I did was got more popular, more successful
Than a lot more things that I've ever done, I probably should pick that cup back up (Haha)

[Verse 1]
I'm sittin' here lookin' at Keisha, like, ""Do you love me, do you love me not?""
Damn, you hit the spot
Taste like candy (Candy), sweet like fruit (Ooh)
Wet like water, can I love on you?
Withdrawals, I'm feelin' different, every day I need a dose
Every now and thеn I'm missin', I got my times when I go ghost
But she minе (Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm), I'm stampin' her
Priority status, so them other bitches mad at her (Too mad, ha)
Thumbin' through a hunnid thou', I spent that times two on you
Caught myself cuttin' you loose, then I pop back up like peekaboo
Here I go, flyer than most, Louis V coat
Gas station, coffee cup full, I don't drive boats, no
Money can't buy happiness but she found love inside a G
Head and somethin' to eat, that's all a thug nigga need
No lie you get me higher than the prices on my weed
I'm displayin' my feelings like I'm wearing 'em on my sleeve (See)

[Pre-Chorus]
One minute I'm done with you, the next one I be runnin' back
Go your way, I go my way but somehow we be still attached
Tryna find my answers with this cup, but ain't no truth in that
They be like, I'm dumb for fuckin' with you, I spend stupid racks
You might also like[Chorus]
I'm sittin' here knowing I don't need ya pouring O's in the liter
Sippin' chaser with my reefer, can't get my mind off Wockesha
Watch me put my heart in this cup
In my feelings, she my therapist, I'ma talk to this cup (I swear)

[Verse 2]
Ring around the rose-z, cup full of OZ's
I hope I don't OD, she keep sayin', ""Pour me""
Turn me to that purple demon emoji (Devil)
Fuck me like you miss me, it's been a whole week
This ain't no playground love, we grown (Too grown)
I'm too fucked up, I paid four hunnid for a zone (That strong)
My bitch don't like you, you've been fuckin' up my home (In my house)
Relapsin' every time I try to leave you 'lone (I relapse, girl)
Every nigga in the street lookin' for her but she rare
Dark skin, purple hair, stingy, with her hard to share (I can't)
Never needed nobody but it feel good to have somebody (That somebody)
Drop you and pick you up whenever I feel like it
This shit toxic
Let me know if you feel me, hmm-hmm (Hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm, hmm)
I gotta stop it, I must stop it

[Pre-Chorus]
One minute I'm done with you, the next one I be runnin' back
Go your way, I go my way but somehow we be still attached
Tryna find my answers with this cup, but ain't no truth in that
They be like, I'm dumb for fuckin' with you, I spend stupid racks

I'm sittin' here knowing I don't need ya pouring O's in the liter

Back then, I could've convinced myself
That maybe you called when I was out
But you didn't know what to say, so you didn't leave a message
And that you're probably at home right now, sound asleep
'Cause goin' out isn't really your thing
And I wouldn't have a clue what you been up to lately
Or who you been up to it with
But when I don't miss your calls, I miss you callin'
And I go 'round and 'round again

You dig? Yeah, hold up, hm

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I'ma pull up so lit, I just might crash, dawg
Let me take this Balenciaga mask off to ask y'all, ""Who asked y'all?""
Cita told me to stunt my ass off, that's all
Bop-bop-bop-bop-bop, he was a good cat, my bad, dawg
Don't put no K after that B-Boy, ""Bad kall,"" that's flag talk
Fuck around and knock your flag off, I had to
I wore a Gat' before a tattoo, I had to
As a matter of fact, I had two
No cap, I'm on them capsules, I done relapsed, boo
But I been on my feet since Cinderella lost her glass shoe
The cash blue, but I'm still seein' green
I'm in the bathroom, and I'm peein' lean
My bitch a vacuum
I told her, ""Keep me clean,"" the scene serene
I'm a badonkadonk and bikini fiend
I just need a queen that ain't scared to fuck a Stephen King
I used to live next door to Drake and Momma Dee
And Lisa Dee on Eagle Street
How I go from bars on the screen door to the TV screen?
Don't ask me, but never change the channel
Gucci flannel, Gucci socks, Gucci sandals
Gucci teddy bears, and pandas, not fake
Propaganda 'bout to blow out the candle
My lil' ho out Atlanta, got a ho out Atlanta
With a ho out Atlanta, she a ho out Atlanta
We get it, it's the same in each city
My bitch dance better than P. Diddy's
And ever since the pandemic
They don't wanna let Drake out of Canada
I been screamin', ""Free Drizzy""
I know bae trust my vision but don't want me to see prison
Said, ""I can't make no promises, either leave or come visit
But leave the keys to your heart next to your soul and your spirit""
Some see graffiti as art, some could see hoes to be women
But I'm the greediest shark amongst an ocean of killers
I put you six feet deep, I'm bein' socially distant
Nina Ross on the hip, the .44 is my mistress
Extra shots, extra clips, ain't talkin' videos nor vixens

Life is a beach house, don't let the sand in
I ball in any arena, go let the fans in
I should go cop a new jersey, that's word to Camden
These bitches' time tick-tockin', better stick to dancin'
I D&G the wallet, my money tall and brolic
Big-ass backyards, just so Papa Bear can frolic
One Margherita pizza with Parmesan and garlic
These bitches thirsty, I can see why they alcoholics
Ain't gotta ever talk about it when you are about it
Just bought a new car, not to drive it, but to walk around it
Just call me ""Nicki, cock the blicky,"" the Minaj is silent
Brand new vanilla Maserati, I been Häagen-Dazsin'
He call me solid even though I'm drippin', water diet
Big booty stickin' out, my Daisy Dukes'll cause a riot
These bitches still my sons, who could ever deny it?
My packs hit different, who could ever supply it?
No one bitch could be my opp, that shit offends me
It's corporate giants and machines that went against me
I wash bitches, man, they couldn't even rinse me
She said she hot, I said, ""Well, bitch, come and convince me""
Ain't no C in green, but I'm seein' green
Even with them floor seats, they couldn't see the team

This ain't gon' be the first time that I do numbers on two crutches
Seen more plaques than toothbrushes

Known her eight years and still fuck her like a new husband
Tryna run a country like Putin one day, but who's rushin', who's bluffin'? For real
Who you huggin', who you wanna be lovin'?
I play forty-eight minutes on a torn meniscus, who's subbin'?
El Chico luxury, wanna see my niggas ball so bad, I started up a league
Fuck with me, you niggas can't trouble me from the Doubletree
Step your suites up, I get Oliver to set the beats up
2021, I had to wet the streets up
Your girl was better in the mornin' like a slice of pizza
That's when I had to hit her with the, ""Nice to meet ya""
You niggas think you doin' damage, you just hypin' me up
Face who? I could see a wall of y'all, all of y'all and run straight through
Trust, it's all fun and games until I wanna play too
Ayy, dios mío, the ice is frío on the Jesus, it's bringin' me closer to God
I'm already close to the mob, I'm already known as the G.O.A.T
Could try and get close, but you won't, I already packed the garage

One heart goin' both directions
One love and a couple of questions

This ain't Build a Bitch (A bitch)
You don't get to pick and choose
Different ass and bigger boobs
If my eyes are brown or blue
This ain't Build a Bitch (A bitch)
I'm filled with flaws and attitude
So if you need perfect, I'm not built for you (Yeah)

Bob the Builder broke my heart
Told me I need fixing
Said that I'm just nuts and bolts
Lotta parts were missing
Curvy like a cursive font
Virgin and a vixen
That's the kind of girl he wants
But he forgot

Black Goku, slap these rap hopefuls
Snatch ya stacked vocal tracks off the Pro Tools
Lemme show you how a pro move
I could take a stroll in the middle of Chernobyl
I could put the whole damn game in a chokehold
Stunner to the dome, on the floor like I'm Stone Cold
Butter with the flows when I float on the ropes though
You don't really wanna be the target in my focal
Put a shell to ya back like a slowbro
Neo when I move, see the whole world in slo-mo
Killa with the tools, it ain't sweet when I reign bows
Bodies in thе morgue looking more like Janе Does
Know they fresh like them halos a day old
Drapeto never been a slave to a name on a payroll
Still they wanna play with the god, you ain't Kraytos
You the goat? Nah, scapegoat
Cut the head, feed it to a volcano
Swerving down the 95 South like J. Cole
I was in the cut so much, had to lay low
Couldn't get a cut, now I look like a young Hov
The rap basquiat, feel like I'm Pac with locs
Two shots in the dark when I pop a cop
Need despot on top like I'm Papa Doc
And I rock when I drop, they just talk a lot
So stop, watch how I move
Do it broad day like we strike at high noon
Family ties like crips and pyroos
Gotta be nice when I script a haiku
All my niggas sinners, never lift a bible, we tribal
It's still fuck you and the god that you pray to
One punch leave 'em slumped like they smoking on K2
Whole village full'a killers and you know they got K2s

2021,interlude,J. Cole,"[Intro]
Right, right, right, right
Something's got a hold on me
Right, right, right, right
Sometimes I think pain is just a lack of understanding
If we could only understand it all, would we feel no pain?
God must feel no pain
Something's got a hold on me
Only joy
Does this mean even our suffering pleases him?

[Verse]
Lost in a cloud of marijuana
Young Carolina nigga, fish out of water
Step-daddy just had a daughter with another woman
Mama ain't recover yet
Callin' me at 12 at night
She drunk as fuck and I'm upset
'Cause why she always using me for crutch?
Growin' up I used to always see her up
Late as shit, cigarette smoke and greatest hits from Marvin Gaye
She kill a whole bottle of some cheap chardonnay
I gotta leave this house 'cause part of me dies when I see her like this
Too young to deal with pain
I'd rather run the streets than see her kill herself
So 'Ville became my escape from a feelin' I hate
Mama cursing me out
Depression's such a villainous state
I used to stay out later on purpose
Subconsciously I was nervous that if I came home early then what would surface was her inner demons
And then I'd have to end up seein' my hero on ground zero
Tears flow while Al Green blow
Love and happiness
I wish that I could say the right words to cheer her up
I wish her son's love was enough
I tell her, ""Mama, go to sleep""
She tell me ""Boy, hush. You better pray to God you never get your heart crushed""
I shake my head in frustration
Head to my room and I can still hear the tunes with my door shut
Fuck it though, a couple more months I'll be gone
Off to college and dorms
Foolin' myself, thinkin' problems are gone
But now it's 1 AM and my mama dialin' my phone
I know she intoxicated and soon this high that I'm on comes crashin' down
She lit, talkin' drunk shit, I'm pissed
But I'm still all ears like Basset Hounds
Thinkin' to myself, ""Maybe my mama need help
Don't she got work in the morning?
Why she do this to herself?
Hate how she slurrin' her words
Soundin' so fuckin' absurd
This ain't the woman I know, why I just sit and observe?
Why don't I say how I feel?
When I do, she's defensive for real
Well maybe things get better with time, I heard it heals
Little did I know how deep her sadness would go
Lookin' back, I wish I woulda did more instead of runnin'

Wasn't a lot but enough for a quick fix

Her nigga came through, he was all on some bitch shit
Didn't know I was raw and my hands was so gifted

Couple knots made him drop like he drunk or he lifted
Fought another nigga after I thought was some kinship
Throwing up both of our sets which ended the friendship
Gave respect neck to neck, my nigga didn't back down
Had 'em standing up then he ended up back down
His hands in my life now they ended up flat now
Flat like a wing, let's see if he flap now
Had enough, it was tough only lasted about one round

Made 'em run, it was funny, he was scared of the gun sound
Made 'em shit, he a bitch, by the car he was ducked down

Since a jit stood tall with a kickstand
Thinking of a plan to get quick bands
Falling in deep with the quicksand
Flag out my ass, no quick brand
I was packing on the pounds, got my weight up
Had beef on the streets, had to stay up
Betty Crocker showed me how to bake a cake, bruh
Doing that put everything I love at stake, bruh
Since a jit stood tall with a kickstand
Thinking of a plan to get quick bands
Falling in deep with the quicksand
Flag out my ass, no quick brand
I was packing on the pounds, got my weight up
Had beef on the streets, had to stay up
Betty Crocker showed me how to bake a cake, bruh
Doing that put everything I love at stake, bruh

I was out taking shots
Throwing down at the spot
Three sheets, just me and the guys
Every single Saturday night
I was killing time, crushing cans
Trying not to catch a tan
'Cause I was under them neon lights
Every single Saturday night, yeah
Everybody knew they could find me there
And right out of the blue, right out of nowhere
Out of nowhere

[Chorus]
Sittin’ over in the corner, baby, I saw
Pretty red lips, working on a White Claw
Shakin' to a little “Shook Me All Night Long”
And I thought, ""Man, what a beautiful sight""
Ain't a mornin’ you don't wake up in my shirt now
Even holding hands walkin' out of church now
Who'd of thought, baby, looking back that
That would be my last single Saturday night?
Yeah
My last single Saturday night

[Verse 2]
And now when I'm out, havin' a drink or two
If they see me, huh, they see you
'Cause, girl, I got you by my side
Every single Saturday night, yeah
Every now and then, the boys tell me they miss me
Oh but they all get it 'cause they were right there with me
Yeah with me, when

Ain't nobody 'round here on your level
You're so far away
You're pouring your heart out

2021,100.mil',J. Cole & Bas,"[Round 1: Arsonal]
Nigga suck my dick!
In the most disrespectful way I can spit it to you
All that shit you say you wishin' a nigga would do, niggas did it to you
I'll leave a hole big enough to fit a midget through
I'ma introduce the world to a clown
And I don't need help from Steven King to present It to you
Steven King Presents It, oh it's a different vibe
All that Champion Of The Year money, this clown ass nigga still don't know how to use his penny wise (Pennywise)
But when me and Jimmie rock, Suge the shooter and driver, watch how the Hemi slide
Shotgun out the window in Compton, the same alley where Ricky died
Oh nah that was South Central
So I let a round hit you from a loud pistol
When I could quietly stab you in the navel and just drag what's in the south, central
Out in Compton, I'll roll in ya neighborhood, hippie vibes
Six shooter, old man revolver, but I give a 60, five
Oh but you Nutty Blocc, you Compton Crip, my mistake then
You still bang the Six God, you'll get beat wit' a .40 ain't talkin' Drake friend
Ain't no beast to unleash you just be caged in
How I'ma believe the bars your pen state when it took you this long to get past the bars in the state pen'?
But you Nutty Blocc, Compton Crip, big C's you throwin' 'round
'Til you assigned a wheelchair for the rest of ya life, pussy  you Rolling now
I'll grab ya bitch head, while she bobbin' for apples and push her nose in now
Why? Cause I promised Gotti if he went back to jail I would hold you down
Oh but you big Crip? But you give me no option
How I'm supposed to believe your set run the west when half the world includin' the neutral niggas refer to yo' city as ""Bompton""
Let a nigga say they from ""Bewark, New Jersey""
Nigga that semi go choppin'
Smack, Chico, Beasley, Avoca- ain't no fuckin' video's droppin'
I make a movie wit' the toaster, shotgun in the armpit
Kick back gon' make me do the Lil' Uzi wit' the shoulder straps
I would've brought a TEC wit' a 100 clip just so I could give him a Hot 97
And niggas wonder why I Flex
I'm from a city where mothers die for sets
I really live what's in my notebook pussy, my life a Butterfly Effect
I said, nigga don't talk that street shit to the concrete
Cause I laid the foundation and paved the way for you Prodigy's to be able to cause Havoc and even Mobb Deep
Nigga my .9 speak
I pull up on Gotti at five guys, we nine deep
Hmm, now I beat y'all all of this hair on his side burns; Ashanti
I'll get this dummy shot, both arms up, I'm doin' the Mummy Bop
My whole avenue retarded, ""Me, I'm really from Nutty Blocc""
Now if we heard Gotti shootin', what he playin'? Prolly 2K
For nigga keep goin' back to jail on purpose, what that mean to y'all? Prolly he gay
Ya mother said you can be anything you put ya mind to, right? And she proud of you, hey
Well I could give a fuck what ya ma-ma-mama said bitch, you ain't Bobby Boucher
So don't talk to me like I'm stupid, cause your Tommy unemployed
Bitch I ain't Cole
Stab wound through his chest, then push the bullet through the same hole
I never went down, cause I never got caught, my niggas ain't told
Why? Cause I do my shit all by my lonely like I'm J. Cole
I don't wanna know what ya life like
Or what ya stain in ya hood and what your stripes like
Just know that I got triple what they paid you, plus PayPerView, so what's your price like?
Kimbo Slice, Miami backyard, I'm tryin' to fight fight
Kevin Hart told me Gotti the nigga tryin' to go night night
Now I tried to show you that there's a better you nigga
A side of you that you never knew
I'ma show you how involving yourself in the beef will turn you to a vegetable
Nigga you ever have real fiends beggin' you for the residue?
I'm from a city where niggas will literally chop ya neck off ya shoulder just to say they got ahead of you
You talkin' like you play wit' birds?
Nigga, ya dead homies got what they deserved
I came to Compton just to spit in ya mother mouth and smoke my favorite herb
Now you in front of the judge and you don't play with verbs
Stupid nigga got convicted for everything he was up against
Y'all tryin' to convince me that he got a way with words
Man my shit is real and you can see it in my eyes
Suck my dick! And let these people believe them lies
Nigga time!
You might also like[Round 1: Geechi Gotti]
Nigga that shit was fire!
For real, he was spittin' some retarded shit
Up here dressed like a 'How To Be A Crip' starter kit
Nigga you'se a bitch!
Do somethin', I'll really shoot somethin'
Cross my line, and I'll shut the Volume down like a mute button
Nigga you stuntin'
I liked you better back in them Grind Time mode
But this the URL, this my shit now
And ever since I been the Champ, all these niggas want smoke
I don't see no lies told
Ask Smack
Soon as these niggas come to the crib, I'm the first thing they ask about like the wi-fi code
Nigga y'all like hoes, be in ya inner circle's whisperin' 'bout me
'Til you meet me and realize you just a 300 and I'm a Bentley
Breakfast Club ass niggas, y'all see (C) Da God and envy
You be on D shit, shout out to them Damu's
Y'all know how we do
My real niggas know if I holla ""Asante""
“Background”: ketu
See now if he knew, he would've hollered out ketu
But see that's why I got a question Crippin', this a lesson given
You need to figure out if gang bangin' was yo' best decision
See the west is listenin'
Just like we supposed to, cause you from New Jersey and Grape Street
So do you got a problem with the east coast too?
Cause Grape Street beef wit' the east coast, but you from the east coast
Ain't that like a conflict of interest?
I guess what's happenin' in Watts ain't none of y'all niggas business
Y'all niggas bitches, you a hoe Ars'
Gotti let the fo' spark
Catch him in his whip, I'll turn that bitch to a go kart
Headshot, need the locks on the do'; I'm Joe Clark
You don't want no part
I already bodied Suge, now Arsonal comin' straight for a vengeance
It ain't jelly when I say I got some artificial Grapes on my biscuits
Y'all be my witness
I'ma need two caskets, Red can get it too since you yappin'
But his apple in a box with the Grapes, it's a fruit basket
Nigga I'm spazzin', Gotti got the juice now
Mix Red's blood on top of Grapes and make it Fruit Town
Nigga you clowns, I'm a real nigga, that shit ain't on me, bitch the shit in me
Gun under the chin, leave a hole that exit out the top, that shit a chimney
It offend me, when you be actin' like you from them JD projects, but ain't put on none of them niggas
But you on the rap game makin' money for one of JD's projects
But I guess, I'll let the .40 bank heads, that's if he outta line
Lemon squeeze in his face, it's our (sour) time
The bottom line, I got a lot of ways I can murder him
If I'm choosing where to shoot, I'ma pick his locks like a burglary
The nerve of me, I'm back on that dumb shit
Hand gun with the drum clip, I'm dumpin' the .40, I want a young bitch
Nigga, one hit, will have his mind gone, he brain dead
Now a machine help him with his words like Rhymezone
Nigga we in different time zones
I'm on that Pacific time, grippin' mine
If this don't work, Twork voice, I got a bigga .9
This a crime
I was in jail when my patna got shot, DOA
I'm talkin' he didn't get away to the doctor
I came home to put in work for him, feelin' just like Meek in a helicopter
Cause I got out and went straight to a chopper
You in the face of a mobster!
I'll have every nigga here stretch him
Pistol whip, blunt force to the face, this peer pressure
These niggas talkin', well I'ma keep on talkin'
Nina sparkin', I've been on so many missions, bitch I'm tired of guns, I got heat exhaustion
This nigga's a fuckin' bus driver
Rappin' gangsta shit
I don't believe the nonsense, I'll show up to your job and pop on campus, it's a parent teacher conference
Nigga we believe in violence
I'll catch ya bitch and let the lead pop
All I heard was ""ooh"" ""ah"" ""eh"" before the headshot
The same bitch with different Screams; Sidney Prescott
The TEC's cocked, I get ya granny goin' to bed, put the silencer on it so the sound gone
If I let it spray, think ""graduation day"", that old bitch gettin' caped wit' her gown on
You a clown bro, Shoebox saved you in Detroit, that's the only reason you around us bro
I came from shootouts, bustin' 'til there ain't shit comin' out this hoe
I'm sayin', we both been saved by the Cal' befo'
And when it's-
Y'all can tell, you can see it in they eyes
Go 'head make niggas believe them lies
Nigga time
[Round 2: Arsonal]
Nigga suck my dick! For the second time
And now I said it to your face Crip
This like workplace harassment
I violate all your personal space bitch
I'm that cousin always on punishment, I'm not the nigga you can play wit'
So what I'm from the east nigga, gang bangin' is gang bangin', we on the same shit
I ain't new to this, I've been bangin' half my life, you must be misinformed
Oh I get it, I hardly, it hardly rain in southern California so you think we weather a different storm
Y'all know why me and this Ray Swag in the face ass nigga ain't never gon' get along?
Because you'd rather go to jail than break yo' mama heart showin' you tough, provin' some other niggas wrong
You still tryin' to prove you tough when you ride wit' yo' city
You said it yo'self you in the Grandee's 24/7 nigga
So when you gonna spend some time wit' yo' kids?
Yo youngest son really miss his daddy
And yo' patna teachin' him how to hold a gun
It's funny you spent more time in jail with yo' bunkie, but didn't spend that much time outside wit' yo' oldest son
See, who don't spend time wit' they kids, I don't support those
It's my job to fire, and leave you dead in your ""showin' up to court clothes.""
Niggas who think they Nutty on my Blocc, I extort those
All you hear is a loud BANG, remind you of how that county cell door close
Gettin' locked up is easy nigga
I can do some shit right now that's gon' land me in jail
Why is it so hard for you niggas to realize bein' absent from your kids life will leave them damaged as well?
You out here glorifyin' incarceration, this nigga scared to get mail
Nigga I give you five years tops 'til you and your oldest son together sharin' a cell
Nigga what?!
You think that jail shit scare me now?
Naw, what's scary is bein' the only nigga free in yo' hood and you gotta take care of all of yo' homies' families now
I'm on the phone with my nigga that's never comin' home
Tellin' him I just let his granny down
Nigga I come to Cali just to walk on yo' grass pussy, you Stanley now
Nigga you gon' meet karma
My hands speak fast and my reach longer
I never went to prison and I stayed free, so who really been on these streets longer?
Oh, oh oh, I'll slap this bitch, now it's gettin' domestic
You standin' there wit' yo' head down and yo' hands behind yo' back
You that used to gettin' arrested?
All that time you spent away from your two boys? I blame the game for it
But God already made him pay for it
They gave him life in the insane asylum, and they assigned him to the A. Ward
I'ma be straight forward, I'ma son of a gun, my mama was ratchet
But she told me, ""Never speak about ya pops.""
I ain't never tell on a soul, nothin' to speak about the cops
You got one style of rap nigga, you don't speak about a lot
But I get it, you wrote all your bars in prison you don't really know how to think outside the box
Nigga ya whole life was tied to the system
Stupid, you always guilty, DUH
That's why you rhyme with conviction
You look the part so ya lines in convincin'
Low cut, fucked up teeth Crip
Nigga you match beyond the description
And the nigga on Youtube, he got- he- he like, ""Yo, welcome to my hood. This the trap trap
The building over there on 165 and 166, oh that's where they make the packs at
Oh yeah that alley over there when the cops run down it's where we throw the straps at.""
Dispatch on the other line like, ""10-4 did you catch that?""
He ain't done he still goin', he said, ""Yo aye cuz, this wall right here cuz, it's full of dead homies I wish I could bring back to life
Lil' Half A Slice, on Nutty man he was a killer. He lived the savage life.""
He said, ""Aye cuz, what he'd kill, 'bout ten niggas before he made the sacrifice?""
Nigga you tellin' everything, you out here gettin' niggas indited in the after-life
Ya name ""Bay Loc""
You a fat Derrick Rose, man you gon' stay broke
And a victim of the system
No anesthesia through this incision, we need you to stay woke
Nigga, I'm here to snatch every bit of saliva out ya bae throat
Hit once then make the bitch disappear like she Def Loaf
Now between me and Gotti, it's a distance
You from where gang bangin' originated, so why I'm
{Stream cuts out}

Between me and Gotti it's a distance
Cause you went from where gang bangin' originated, but I'm more world wide known for this Crippin'
I'm Crip, you gon' be disabled there's a difference
Your bitch gotta take my dick twice a day after she eat, my shit prescription
Some shit'll never change, I'm super Crip
In my car I got the handicap sign up and everythang
That mean I get to park closer to ya job givin' me the aim
Dessy rang, I'm hittin' innocent by-standards,  I ain't got deadly aim
So I cut him in slow-mo
Word to Dobo, I put that on everythang
I go berserk on him
Bury his body I throw the dirt on him
I set him up, I had my unemployed bitch throw the work on him
Catch ya spirit headed to the afterlife, I throw the scope on him
But I ain't pull the trigger, old fashioned ass whoopin'
Beat him wit' the stick until it broke on him
He a rat, I put the cheese on his head like he from Green Bay
You the man? Well not 'round here, nigga Dikembe
Boy, the way I do you with this fourth and inches, just watch the replay
I'ma keep on cuttin' him and bringin' him back like I was a DJ
I'll put the muzzle on it, then I aim .9
What that mean? I kill him and give that moment of silence at the same time
As long as he get hospitalized tonight, I'll remain calm
Cause honestly, Gotti he could Die Another Day word to James Bond
My shit is real, you can see it in my eyes
Suck my dick and let these niggas believe yo' lies
Nigga time!

[Round 2: Geechi Gotti]
All these, behind bars bars, was the type of shit you had niggas laughin' 'bout
I find it funny, how you could condemn me cause I'm goin' to jail for the shit you be rappin' 'bout
I got you niggas bangin' again
If y'all wasn't doin' it then, nigga don't be doin' it now
Tryin' to show me you gangsta, only make me think you niggas clowns
Even the vets, talk all that shit about the PG process
Then get on the card with me and all of a sudden it's the Proving Grounds
Nigga, you'se a clown
You was a Blood I heard that turned Grape Street
That's some weird shit
I knew he was a fag, cause only queers switch
Nigga real shit, you a bitch in the streets but you wanna be a Crip in the ring
Arm to his chest, look like his shit in a sling
This bitch wit' a beam
I'll steam his face, nigga I'll kill ya kid, now you a seedless Grape
Ain't no need to hate nigga, y'all straight bitches
The only battle rappers from Grape Street, is Aktive and Dre Vishiss
Tryin' to act like Grape a hood that you love
You givin' him three up top but you never booked him on UDubb!
Nigga, I'm disrespectful just like cuz, except the bars heavy
I'll kidnap ya daughter, you find her Trapped In The Closet wit' R. Kelly
Yeah I'm disrespectful, you ain't gon' do a damn thang 'bout it
I'll kill that lil' bitch, show up to her funeral, get her obituary, make a paper plane out it
Yo' little girl, that's ya world? You better keep her out my way aight
I usually don't hit kids, but today I might
Choke her, 'til you got a Blueface baby, 'Yeah Aight'
You goddamn right, I'll put the blade to his daughter's scalp
Make sure that lil' bitch in pain
How the fuck y'all callin' Arsonal ""Da Rebel"" but I'm the one goin' against the grain
This shit insane
Ya baby mama look good, ooh them tits soft
After I fuck her I use his daughter clothes to wipe my dick off
I'm disrespectful, I'm tryin' to figure him out
I hope on them field trips they say, ""This dude nuts""
I hope on them field trips you catch yo' daughter givin' head on the back of ya school bus
This dude nuts
I been tryin' to figure him out
I seen his daughter, I said ""You would never succeed (suck seed) until somebody bust they kids in ya mouth!""
Look what he did for the clout!
He been rappin' like that 15+
I can't remember a time he was lyrical
The King Of Disrespect? He ain't got enough respect for the craft to write fire material
I'm tired of hearin' you
I don't even think you no real nigga, I can tell by yo' demeanor
You became a bus driver cause you ain't have the smarts to be a teacher
Nigga you a leecher
Ride every nigga wave that you close to
Scream Fetty Wap name all last year, he ain't even post you
You a weirdo
Portrayed to be a Loc by your peers though
I know ya fears bro
You wear that purple flag so in Cali you got a spot for protection
But tell these niggas how when you in Cali you scared to even go to ya section
Nigga look in the mirror
I be he see a hoe in the reflection
I'm talkin' real shit, ain't nothin' outta context
If he wasn't a rapper, he wouldn't have even stepped foot in them projects
But I guess, he better be glad he can rap
Cause you ain't no shooter from them Bricks, that's an actual fact
But since you can rap and you bangin' they shit puttin' 'em on
They let him do it, they just gotta tax you for that
It's tax season! The whole projects claimin' him as a dependent
Payin' grown men for protection, that gotta be weird
Tell Suge he should be cool showin' up now, they show love to big bitches 'round this time of the year
We not the same!
I really had to put in work for my name
True story, I done really put niggas on shirts for the game
This nigga made a game; Arsonal's Revenge
(Aye, for real they gon' buy that shit)
Arsonal's Revenge, aye but that don't mean he 'bout his business or his wealth
It's just like I been tellin' y'all
He good at creatin' an image for himself
Yeah you bang Grape Street but in Watts you be scared faggot, I know ya story
Can't show up to the projects without a care package
Every time he come over there, shit be feelin' like Christmas
Got him givin' out money and free Fetty Wap tickets
How he talkin' Grape Street like he really wit' that
If he was, how come when Suge got robbed he ain't get his shit back?
Grape Street that nigga, Grape Street this
Them niggas took ya phone and ya motherfuckin' jewelry, you ain't been back on Grape Street since
He had trouble wit' that
Brand new .50, I can't even feel the kickback
This a clean cal', you can tell by the Gun Title it got a Double Impact
Nigga if you ain't shootin' shit, you can't even talk to Gotti
I'm a walkin' homi
Nigga believe none of what you hear and only half of what you see
They prolly don't even understand what I'm talkin' prolly
Cause the news said I dropped a nigga, that was a lie
I caught the body!
And when it's real, y'all tell
(You can see it in they eyes
Go head, it's yo' turn, make them nigga believe them lies
Nigga time)

[Round 3: Arsonal]
Nigga suck my dick! Third times a charm
I thought you would've swung by now
This nigga ain't got no fight left in him, he like, ""He already won by now.""
I admire you knowin' you couldn't beat me but him still try
But you popped up at the wrong time, that's an in-field fly
Meaning ya hitter out immediately
Ya runners? Lookin' hesitant
12, 13, 14 letters of the alphabet, Gotti you way outta ya element
Get ya bars up, I don't get stuck in the moment, I'll leave a star struck
Serve him through the window early morn', ""Welcome to Starbucks""
Gun spark, light flash, you think a photo man behind ya
No! Tommy in his face barkin' in his face like, ""I don't know no damn Kiana.""
I'ma be real wit' niggas
Smack and Beasley, they tryin' to build a nigga
Code word: Salt Bae
They fly me in to give a meal (mil') to niggas
Telekinesis powers when I'm mad, I Matilda niggas
I got still for niggas, meet my New Edition, I'm Johnny Gill wit' niggas
BOOM! Through ya front door, knock ya bitch up, then pick her up
Put the deuce to his head like I was tryin' to fuck the picture up
Show up to the funeral, reach in the casket and grab ya sister butt
Cause my first name ""I Don't"", last name ""Give A Fuck""
AKA Durrell ""Disrespectful"" Jones
I'm not ya friend brother
I'll slap the dog shit outta you and ya friend mother
How many times you copped out at court? Let's not pretend brother
You would've been a house nigga, and I can tell by ya skin color
Nigga my tool is chunky, ya father fell in love with a foolish junkie
I stay ten toes down with my fuckin' chin up, I don't care who confront me
You a flunky and ya whole hood green
That's why ya son remind me of the lil' nigga H&M had referred to as the ""coolest monkey""
I wish I was the doctor standin' in-between ya bitch legs when she was givin' birth
Cause that would've solidified my spot as the one nigga who get to smack that lil' nigga first
Yeah, umbilical cord wrapped around his neck
You want a birth death?
I almost kill him on purpose just to say him and watch him struggle through his first breaths
Soon as the nigga 'bout to walk, I clip him before he take his first steps
Him and his other brother, they competin' who gon' have the worst death
Rebel shit
This level of success, you will never get
Special Olympics, I'm here to show y'all who the better Crip
Grape Street, we the gang
Speak in vain, heaters bang
We Crippin' form a different point of view, we don't see the same
Nigga, to me you still a tiny Loc nigga
So take this L and let that L sit
You came in here lookin' for Ars' and got Durrell bitch
I'm quick to let a shell kick
For goin' against the grain, what I'm raising (raisin) will put a Nut' in the bag we makin' trail mix
But you don't even think like that
Last night in Le Palace you yellin', ""Anything possible"" and you don't even drink like that
I'll walk up in ya son's school
Go to the oldest lil' nigga class
Rex ad lib, yell ""That nigga dead!"" when he say he miss his dad
Man, in front of his classmates I'll fuckin' whip his ass
Man, and then walk downstairs and tell ya younger son, ""Go stand in the street in front of that hell cat.""
Then I did the dash
Y'all wanna know what happened next?
I hit his ass!
I knocked him so far back he flew into the Ghost Of Christmas Past
Last time the nigga seen his daddy, he had to kiss the glass
Next time gon' be to identify him and zip the bag
I said, my bitch toughened up
I ain't gotta shoot or do an uppercut
Code word: Orgasm
(What that mean?)
She was trained to squirt and bust a Nut'

[Girl in crowd]
Talk naaasty!

[Arsonal]
He said, she said, I don't care what niggas said 'bout him
One day he true blue, BAOW! Next mornin' niggas read (red) 'bout him
Baow! Baow! Baow! Another one blew (blue)
Blaow! And it knocked all of the red out him
Then you gon' see a Grape Street Crip moonwalkin' through the blood just to say I did it in red bottoms
Now if I pull up, it's gon' be Glocks involved
Mops and all, I'm lettin' rockets off
{Cell phone sound} Brrrrrrrt
The doctor makin' a Compton call
Surgery! Blottin' up his exit wounds with cotton balls
You just sell wigs, I get paid to knock 'em off!
I said, is we talkin' colors here? Or your profession and how you color hair?
I'll slap ya nephew in front of ya mother to see if ya brother care
Somebody please dare me to do it
(I dare you)
Do I hear a double dare?
My shit is real, my shit is raw my shit is authentic
Ya bitch mouth had my finger, dick and balls in it
She did it in front of ya house and didn't even give a fuck, cause the car tinted
We had a gang bang last night...she was involved in it
My shit is real, my shit is raw my shit is authentic
And you can't spell ""Bars"" without puttin' that ""Ars"" in it

[Smack]
Last round it's on-

[Arsonal]
Nah, sike I lied nigga
No, sike I lied nigga
Sike you died nigga
You made ten thousand dollars
Ten thou- man that's pocket change
You know what happened when they Dow jumped?
Man, let's just say I'm tied into the stock exchange
I mean, you said I was on tour, I was gettin' a lot of money with Fetty Wap and thangs
Where your Champion Of The Year money?
Cause I got a whole lot of gwap and thangs
You got Champion Of The Year money, why don't you put it to your ear dummy
This ""Trapion"" Of The Year money
Time nigga

[Round 3: Geechi Gotti]
Aye, y'all just seen that stack that this nigga pulled out?
That's a whole lot of money that he made from this art form
I hope after you die today, you give a little bit of that money to ya BM and ya daughter, that can be a nice lil' start for 'em
I mean you gotta give 'em somethin', cause I heard the stories
They said you barely for 'em
I'm just sayin', they bitches better pray they in ya will (wheel) like a car horn
Nitty already buried Suge
Now these niggas finna get a casket together
Said he ain't know Shotgun...they up here rappin' together
Y'all the fakest of friends
Headshot, when I say, ""The doc tryin' to patch things up"", he ain't makin' amends
Ain't no shakin' my hand
You do a whole lotta weak shit
In the field, the strap got no safety, we in goal line defense
They said ""Bro ain't got a weakness"" that's 'til the can' clap you
Hospital beds, rubber bands wrap you
His family like, ""How he doin'?""
I don't know, he just popped up on the 'tube, he a Banned battle
Nigga I'm from Nutty Blocc, this shit deeper than just a tattoo
You slapped the hat off Iron, I'll grab the iron and slap you!
That's a fact too, you a lil' boy to me Arsonal
Gave him the .9, the .40 and then the chopper
Just thought he needed a little more in him Arsonal (arsenal)
Fuck Arsonal though, cause if Ray Swag was here I would've shot him right in front of you
I would've gave him two in his brains
Niggas would've been yellin' for you to get ya dawg (dog) like he was loose from the chain
Nigga what you do for the game?
Niggas know I be in Compton with the Crips
AK's really poppin' and shit
Marshall Lawrence, the way we had to chop into bricks
Nigga I'm hittin' licks
A young nigga, makin' racks, I'm just statin' facts
The Feds was hot, I had to play the back
I'm just sayin', the pigs was all over ya dawg (dog), I was bakin' raps (bacon wraps)
Nigga face the facts
How you supposed to be a killer, but you ain't killed nothin' or drilled nothin'?
Walked in the house with blood on my shirt, told my mama I spilled somethin'
Steel dumpin', I'm still thuggin'
If they would've got the prints off the gun I wouldn't be here
You would've seen the kid do life
But I'm way too sharp like a Ginsu knife
Blue rag over the handle, that's a cloth over the grip like the lid too tight
Nigga you too light! I really came from shootouts
Check the score nigga, we up
On the missions, we just pray we make it back like the re-up
You see us, this what real Crippin' look like
You starin' at dope when it come back cooked right
I'm talkin' in the trap
Rare Breeds, we got it brick by brick
The smokers knew it was freebase like we got hit by pitch
Nigga this my shit
And these niggas be worryin' 'bout the wrong shit
Like if we should've stopped watchin' football cause of Kaepernick
Niggas die in my hood everyday, news just don't capture shit
Celebrities could talk about it, we just want 'em to do it
Crazy, while you was busy boycottin' the NFL my boy caught a bullet
I rep the gang to the fullest
I'm talkin' 'bout we shootin' 'til the lead gone
Tell the youth
""Ain't nothin' in this lifestyle but death. That's the truth.""
I be prayin' I was dead wrong
But where I'm from, when you be too hard headed, you end up a head stone
I'm from the streets, that's what they made sidewalks fo'
Niggas done really died on my block
Even standin' too close to the curb will get a nigga hit, we playin' sideline pop
Nigga I'm from the streets for real, they- aye ask about me in my hood
I was a young nigga, lettin' that lead fly shorty
I'm talkin' 16 fuckin' wit' a .40
Tell Lifetime I'm ready to tell my story
Survivin' the streets, if y'all would've seen what I seen, maaan, y'all prolly wouldn't have made it out
I'm tellin' you, this shit prolly would've made cuz quit
So many homies in the cemetery it's like they workin' graveyard shift
Nigga and I peep my nigga Knocca, sometimes I be wishin' I could go wit' him
So many niggas I done lost, I ain't got no mo' love in my heart
{Takes off his shoe}
Even my shoe ain't got a sole (soul) in 'em
Nigga every strap, got a pole in 'em
Two shots, that's why I clapped him
Another shot, body bagged him
Cause the third rounds just hit harder like when I be rappin'
It's a real life struggle everyday in the trenches
.40 goin' over my options, I'm tryin' to make a decision
Nigga Roc voice, ""It's me dawg.""
I'm from Nutty Blocc, hub in the dub, Watts
Nigga I show love to my Grape Street so free 03 and free Hogg
And when it's real y'all can tell, y'all can see it in they eyes

See if he can believe them lies

Maybach SUV for my refugees
Buy blocks in the hood, put money in the streets
I was solo when the opps caught me at the gas station
Had it on me, thirty thousand, thought it was my last day
But they ain't even want no smoke
If I had to choose it, murder what she wrote

Pawned my guitar just to pay his bail

Now it just feels like it's wearing and stretching
I'm getting real sick of taking advice
From people that never could stare at reflections (Ooh)
Somewhere in there is a lesson
Y'all ain't evolvin', it's very depressing
I'm at the club with the basketball team
Me and the Cardinals are sharing a section (Facts)
Gotta cherish the present
I'm drinking water and wearing protection
Got a career and I'm very invested
Some people call it a scary obsession (Ooh, period, but)
I like to call it a passion
I can't be sitting relaxin' (Nah, I can't)
PG, we getting some traction
I'm at the venue, it's packed in (Packed out)
I'm digging her accent
I got a B.B. Simon belt on me
And she tryna get it unfastened
That's my type of distraction
That's my type and she Latin (That's facts, ooh)
Got my own flow and I'm 'bout to get a patent

A love letter came through the mail, it said, ""I miss you""
I ripped it up and flushed with the tissue, try to forget you
I ain't got nothing against you, we human, we all got issues
But I'm tired of being tired of being tired
That part of me done died
I see it, then I don't, act like I'm blind
I'm confident it won't be one of mine
I know emotions come with lies, so I tell the truth all the time
Ain't got no sympathy for no bitch
I admit that I'm rich and I'm lit
Jumpin' up on stages, I get two hundred an occasion
Bro had really fucked the game up, we made niggas shut they trap down
They see how I made it, I'm the reason they won't rap now
See me out in traffic, make a hater pull his hat down
The biggest OG's salute me, a stylist can't even style me
The robbers probably wanna get me, I'm hoppin' out Lamborghinis
The youngins turn in my city, they try me, I get it cracking
Some of this still would happen if I never had started rapping
My people them still steady trapping and they still be getting active
I tell 'em to chill, I'm tryna run up these M's
Paid cash and then he post the crib (Nah)
I can't show nobody where my mama live, that's how I 'posed to feel
My niece just asked me were my diamonds real, I said, ""Of course""
I just played the hand that I was dealt, didn't have to force
All around the world they know it's me, they hear my voice

Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Til then, I'll sit my drunk ass on that runway
On this one way

[Chorus: Giveon]
Two-thirty, baby, won't you meet me by The Bean?
Too early, maybe later you can show me things
You know what it is whenever I visit
Windy city, she blowin' me kisses, no
Thirty degrees, way too cold, so hold me tight
Will I see you at the show tonight?
Will I see you at the show tonight?

Jewelry in the safe on arrival
Pistol on J for survival
Lot of people gunnin' for the title
Lot of people tryna take us viral
I'm just tryin' to have a nice night though
Waiter brought the check for the meal
She said, ""Babe, I think there was a typo""
Nah, girl, I got it, that's light though
I could show you bigger things than that
It's gon' be a minute 'til I'm back
Let me give you images that last
AMEX had a limit in the past
I had plenty women in the past
I done plenty sinnin' in the past
You don't need to know, but you can ask
Stickin' on your backstage pass
All access 'cause you bad
You could go wherever with that ass
Show to the shower to the truck
Truck to the club for the party
You go in first with your girls
'Cause I don't know who's out there watchin'

Sipped a little shine from a paper sack that'll

Better get to living 'cause all we've got is here and now

Think I fell in love for the first time
With a girl from Mexico
Thought I found a true love in Malibu, but

Let me make one thing clear, you can buy me a beer
But you ain't taking me home
No pickup lines, I came here tonight
To shed a few tears on my own
But sitting there across the room, I couldn't help but notice you
Seem a little down on your luck too
Yeah, my heart might be breakin', but this seat ain't taken
And you've got me thinkin'

We should be drinkin' alone, together
Drownin' the pain is better
With somebody else who got problems, we ain't gonna solve 'em
But misery loves company

Lips with a whiskey chaser
And a corner booth kiss to make me forget that he's gone

But, I know just what to do

Won't be your one and only, but just 'cause we're lonely

A cross between a zombie apocalypse and B-Bobby ""The

Same reason I wrestle with mania

Consider it to cross me a costly mistake
If they sleepin' on me, the hoes better get insomnia

Pass the Courvoisier (Hey, hey)
In AA with an AK, melee, finna set it like a playdate
Better vacate, retreat like a vacay, mayday (Ayy)

I'm in a mental hospital with a crystal ball
Tryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow?
Risperdal, voices whisper
My fist is balled back up against the wall, pencil drawn
This is just the song to go ballistic on
You just pulled a pistol on the guy with a missile launcher
I'm just a Loch Ness, the mythological
Quick to tell a bitch screw off like a fifth of vodka

If you never gave a damn (Ayy), raise your hand
'Cause I'm about to set trip, vacation plans
I'm on point like my index is, so all you will ever get is
The motherfuckin' finger (Finger), prostate exam ('Xam)
How can I have all these fans and perspire?
Like a liar's pants, I'm on fire
And I got no plans to retire and I'm still the man you admire
These chicks are spazzin' out, I only get more handsome and flyer
I got 'em passin' out like what you do when you hand someone flyers
And what goes around comes around just like the blades on the chainsaw
'Cause I caught the flack, but my dollars stacked right off the bat like a baseball

'Cause I make bands and I call getting cheese a cakewalk (Cheesecake, yeah)

Won't even lend you an ear, ain't even pretending to care
But I tell a bitch I'll marry her if she'll bury her

So they wanna give me the chair
Like a paraplegic, and it's scary, call it Hari Kari
'Cause e'ry Tom and Dick and Harry carry a Merriam motherfuckin' dictionary on 'em
Swearing up and down they can spit, this shit's hilarious

We wouldn't see eye to eye with a staring problem
Get the shaft like a steering column (Monster)
Trigger happy, pack heat, but it's black ink
Evil half of the Bad Meets
Evil, that means take a back seat
Take it back to Fat Beats with a maxi single
Look at my rap sheet, what attracts these people
Is my 'Gangsta Bitch' like Apache with a catchy jingle
I stack chips, you barely got a half-eaten Cheeto
Fill 'em with the venom and eliminate 'em
Other words, I Minute Maid 'em
I don't wanna hurt 'em, but I did, I'm in a fit of rage
I'm murderin' again, nobody will evade
I'm finna kill 'em and dump all their fuckin' bodies in the lake
Obliterating everything, incinerate a renegade
I'm here to make anybody who want it with the pen afraid
But don't nobody want it, but they're gonna get it anyway
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like I'm mentally ill
I'm Attila, kill or be killed, I'm a killer bee, the vanilla gorilla
You're bringin' the killer within me outta me
You don't wanna be the enemy of the demon who entered me
And be on the receivin' end of me, what stupidity it'd be
Every bit of me's the epitome of a spitter
When I'm in the vicinity, motherfucker, you better duck
Or you finna be dead the minute you run into me
A hundred percent of you is a fifth of a percent of me
I'm 'bout to fuckin' finish you, bitch, I'm unfadable
You wanna battle, I'm available, I'm blowin' up like an inflatable

I swear you still the baddest in the room with no makeup
You the type of woman every hood nigga pray for
I vow to stay a hundred, never change up
In that sundress, damn, your body so amazing
Love the way you smell, I'm addicted to your fragrance
It's somethin' about you, but I really can't explain it
Just know that you mine, I tell that nigga he can save it

He was playing games, got you dancing in the middle of the club
Got you dancing in the middle of the club
I know what you chasing, you can only get this feeling from a thug

2013,When I Was Your Man,Bruno Mars,"[Verse 1]
Same bed, but it feels just a little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio, but it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down
'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name

[Pre-Chorus]
It all just sounds like (Ooh, ooh)
Mm, too young, too dumb to realize

[Chorus]
That I should've bought you flowers
And held your hand
Shoulda gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancin'
But she's dancin' with another man

[Verse 2]
Uh, my pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways
Caused a good, strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I'll never, never get to clean up the mess I made, oh
And that haunts me every time I close my eyes

Couldn't help myself, so I walked up and said

Dressed in all pink 'cept my gator shoes, those are green
Draped in a leopard mink, girl standin' next to me
Probably should've washed this, smells like R. Kelly sheets
Piss
But shit, it was ninety-nine cents (Bag it)
Coppin' it, washin' it, 'bout to go and get some compliments

I bought a skeet blanket, then I bought a knee board

Puttin' my defenses up
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack

[Verse 1]
Never put my love out on the line
Never said ""yes"" to the right guy
Never had trouble getting what I want
But when it comes to you, I'm never good enough
When I don't care
I can play 'em like a Ken doll
Won't wash my hair
Then make 'em bounce like a basketball

[Pre-Chorus]
But you make me wanna act like a girl
Paint my nails and wear high heels, yes, you
Make me so nervous that I just can't hold your hand

[Verse]
I heard Puff put hands on Drake
Troy Ave got the ""Tuesday"" kid punched in his face
Chris Brown went on Instagram and told us that his girl fucked Drake
The 'Gram took niggas' followers, they violated Mase
They took 1.5 million, I seen that shit
Mase was so embarrassed, he deleted his shit
J. Cole sold three sixty his first week
Nicki broke up with Safaree and start fucking Meek
Lil Wayne don't want to fuck with Baby
But the contract he signed got him stuck with Baby
I say shit that make niggas think
Five niggas told me K. Michelle pussy stink
Seen Bobby Shmurda on Jimmy Fallon
Jimmy Kimmel, now they got him on Riker's Island
Free the whole GS9
The law hate seeing niggas shine
What they won't say, Im'ma write it
Two cops got killed cause two cops ain't get indicted
They took Eric Garner, shot Mike Brown in the head
And now two innocent cops is dead
And real talk, that's not what's up
The KKK laughing like ""ha, that wasn't none of us""
That probably went over your head
Y'all rather talk about Bill Cosby instead
Or Jay and Solange in the elevator
Do ya know the police upset with the mayor?
Cause he supported the protest
The revolution coming, people just don't know it yet
They know what happened on Love & Hip Hop
Don't know what Young Thug said but still think his shit hot
The realest yearly rap up you ever heard
I'm just stating a few facts and some shit that I heard
G-Unit back together minus The Game
At Summer Jam on stage, niggas took Slow chains
Then Slowbucks tried to set it on Fab and 'em
Cause they was on stage when it happened, they was mad at him
I got to talk about this shit
I'm still bugging now how Angie made that Power switch
Amber and Wiz going through that divorce now
The other day, I seen her twerking on Chris Brown
Suge got shot in the club in front of Chris Brown
Then they tried to say it was meant for Chris Brown
T.I. swung on Floyd and 'em
Rest in peace to Earl Hayes, I did a song with him
Rest in peace to his wife
He killed her then took his own life
Boosie home, Remy back home
LeBron left Miami and went back home
That Ebola had niggas shook
Ray Rice knocked out his wife with the left hook
French got a Kardashian under them sheets
My nigga Jeezy and Rick Ross deaded their beef
But everybody beefing with Iggy
Dre & Jimmy sold Dre Beats for 3 billi

I'm thumbing my way into North Caroline

And I'm a-hoping for Raleigh, I can see my baby tonight

But I ain't turning back to living that old life no more

Walking to the south out of Roanoke
I caught a trucker out of Philly had a nice long toke
But he's a heading west from the Cumberland gap
To Johnson City, Tennessee
And I got to get a move on before the sun
I hear my baby calling my name and I know that she's the only one
And if I die in Raleigh at least I will die free

[Chorus]
So rock me, mama, like a wagon wheel
Rock me, mama, any way you feel
Hey, mama, rock me
Rock me, mama, like the wind and the rain
Rock me, mama, like a southbound train

Okay, back when I was sleeping in my mama crib
Or even back when I was up there in Mohammed crib
Paying seventeen hundred for the rent, money well spent
No heater, but a nigga made heat, may I vent?
Had a thing for ya, even wrote the song ""Dreams"" for ya
‘Cause I had dreams for ya, thoughts of a ring for ya
Childish shit, you know child and shit
Anonymous flowers sent, you know coward shit
Now a nigga signed to Hov, took a power trip
Back home, I'm grown now, and the city's my throne now, huh
The same clubs that I used to get tossed out
Life got Kriss Kross'd: totally crossed out
‘Cause now I'm in this bitch and I'm totally bossed out
Old chicks crying ‘cause they know that they lost out
But I'm still on you, I'm still on you
My drink spill on me, while I feel on you, I'm sayin'—

If I ever get to fuck it'd be the longest bust ever
Love is a drug, like the strongest stuff ever and
Fuck it, I'm on one, you feel me?
She on a power trip, she got me where she want a nigga
Wife'ing in the club, man, my homies gon' disown a nigga
Like, ""Give me twenty dollars, dollars!""
Ass stupid, how you get to college, college?
I'm in your city and I'm wonderin' if you're home now
Went and found a man, but I'm hopin' you're alone now
Can't help but feeling like I dropped the ball, cliché
I used to pop up on you at the mall each day
Now, typically I kick game like Eastbay
But you got a nigga freeze-framed yelling: ""Please play!""
For Pete's sake, homie, pull it together
Just fuck her one time and be through with forever, but—

2013,"Bitch, Don't Kill My Vibe",Kendrick Lamar,"[Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise, Kendrick Lamar]
I am a sinner
Who's prob'ly gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me, Lord, forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away, I got
My drink, I got my music, I would share it, but today I'm yellin'
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes, I can feel a new life, I always
Knew life can be dangerous, I can say that I like a challenge
And you tell me it's painless, you don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture when the color blind is hangin' witcha?
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar, another mistake livin' deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick, I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every makin' of his? Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge, even a small lighter can burn a bridge

[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I can feel the changes, I can feel the new people 'round me
Just wanna be famous, you can see that my city found me
Then put me on stages, to me, that's amazin'
To you, that's a quick check, with all disrespect, let me say this

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm tryna keep it alive and not compromise the feelin' we love
You're tryna keep it deprived and only co-sign what radio does
And I'm lookin' right past ya, we live in a world, we live in a world
On two different axles, you live in a world, you livin' behind
The mirror, I know what you're scared of, the feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to, this shit is vital, I know you had to
Die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain is way more believable
Give me a feasible gain, rather a seasonal name, I'll let the people know
This is somethin' you can blame on yourselves, you can remain stuck in a box
I'ma breakout and then hide every lock, I'ma breakout and then hide every lock

2013,Mama's Broken Heart,Miranda Lambert,"[Verse 1]
I cut my bangs with some rusty kitchen scissors
I screamed his name 'til the neighbors called the cops
I numbed the pain at the expense of my liver
Don't know what I did next, all I know I couldn't stop

[Verse 2]
Word got around to the barflies and the baptists
My mama's phone started ringin' off the hook
I can hear her now, sayin' she ain't gonna have it
Don't matter how you feel, it only matters how you look

[Chorus]
Go and fix your make up, girl, it's just a break up
Run and hide your crazy and start actin' like a lady
'Cause I raised you better, gotta keep it together
Even when you fall apart
But this ain't my mama's broken heart

[Verse 3]
I wish I could be just a little less dramatic
Like a Kennedy when Camelot went down in flames
Leave it to me to be holding the matches
When the fire trucks show up and there's nobody else to blame

[Verse 4]
Can't get revenge and keep a spotless reputation (Ah)
Sometimes revenge's just a choice you gotta make (Ah)
My mama came from a softer generation
Where you get a grip and bite your lip just to save a little face

2013,Carry On,fun.,"[Verse 1]
Well, I woke up to the sound of silence
The cars were cutting like knives in a fist fight
And I found you with a bottle of wine
Your head in the curtains
And heart like the fourth of July
You swore and said
We are not
We are not shining stars
This I know
I never said we are
Though I've never been through hell like that
I've closed enough windows
To know you can never look back

[Chorus]
If you're lost and alone
Or you're sinking like a stone
Carry on
May your past be the sound
Of your feet upon the ground
Carry on
Carry on, carry on

[Verse 2]
So I met up with some friends
At the edge of the night
At a bar off 75
And we talked and talked
About how our parents will die
All our neighbors and wives
But I'd like to think
I can cheat it all
To make up for the times I've been cheated on
And it's nice to know
When I was left for dead
I was found and now I don't roam these streets
I am not the ghost you are to me

Smoky Mountains, nice place to hang around
Moonshine, that's where they make it

And took it all the way to the end of the line
Stepped out in the sun, when my feet hit the sand
What a long, strange trip

I spent my whole life running around (Running around)
Still let the wind kinda blow me around

To a long-legged model
And I traded it in for a whole 'nother world

Well, my friends back home think I've gone and lost my mind
Take a sip of rum and you really would know why

Something 'bout it makes her just want to dance

I can just feel it all slipping away
And babe I can already say that

As long I live, whatever I do
As great as it is, you know what's a bummer
I ain't ever gonna beat this summer with you
Baby, it's true
The taste of your kiss is so bittersweet
I ain't gonna beat
No way I'm gonna beat this summer with you

They'll be rolling up windows and puttin' up tops
Be a cold wind blowin' the leaves through the air
And you won't find a tan line anywhere

Bouncing around in my head

2013,Same Love,Macklemore & Ryan Lewis Featuring Mary Lambert,"[Piano Intro]
[Verse 1: Macklemore]
When I was in the third grade, I thought that I was gay
'Cause I could draw, my uncle was, and I kept my room straight
I told my mom, tears rushing down my face
She's like, ""Ben, you've loved girls since before Pre-K""
Trippin', yeah, I guess she had a point, didn't she?
A bunch of stereotypes all in my head
I remember doing the math like, ""Yeah, I'm good at little league""
A pre-conceived idea of what it all meant
For those that like the same sex had the characteristics
The right-wing conservatives think it's a decision
And you can be cured with some treatment and religion
Man-made, rewiring of a pre-disposition
Playing God, aw nah, here we go
America the brave still fears what we don't know
And ""God loves all his children"" is somehow forgotten
But we paraphrase a book written thirty-five hundred years ago
I don't know
[Chorus: Mary Lambert]
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

If I was gay, I would think hip-hop hates me
Have you read the YouTube comments lately?
""Man, that's gay"" gets dropped on the daily
We've become so numb to what we're sayin'
Our culture founded from oppression
Yet we don't have acceptance for 'em
Call each other faggots behind the keys of a message board
A word rooted in hate, yet our genre still ignores it
And ""gay"" is synonymous with the lesser
It's the same hate that's caused wars from religion
Gender to skin color, the complexion of your pigment
The same fight that led people to walk-outs and sit-ins
It's human rights for everybody, there is no difference
Live on and be yourself
When I was at church they taught me something else
If you preach hate at the service, those words aren't anointed
That holy water that you soak in has been poisoned
When everyone else is more comfortable remaining voiceless
Rather than fighting for humans that have had their rights stolen
I might not be the same, but that's not important
No freedom 'til we're equal, damn right I support it
[Trombone Interlude]
[Chorus: Mary Lambert]
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
[Verse 3: Macklemore]
We press play, don't press pause, progress, march on
With a veil over our eyes, we turn our back on the cause
'Til the day that my uncles can be united by law
When kids are walking 'round the hallway
Plagued by a pain in their heart
A world so hateful, some would rather die than be who they are
And a certificate on paper isn't gonna solve it all
But it's a damn good place to start
No law's gonna change us, we have to change us
Whatever god you believe in, we come from the same one
Strip away the fear, underneath it's all the same love
About time that we raised up, sing
[Chorus: Mary Lambert]
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

He said he came from Jamaica, he owned a couple acres
A couple fake visas 'cause he never got his papers
Gave up on love, fucking with them heart breakers
But he was gettin' money with the movers and the shakers
He was mixed with a couple things, ball like a couple rings
Bricks in the condo and grams to Sing Sing
Left arm, baby mother tatted
Five year bid up north when they ratted
Anyway, I felt him, helped him, put him on lock, seat belt him
Took him out to Belgium, welcome
Bitches this pretty, that's seldom
This box better than the box he was held in
I'm Momma Dee in that order, I call him Daddy like daughters
He like it when I get drunk, but I like it when he be sober
That's top of the toppa, I never fuck with beginners
I let him play with my pussy then lick it off of his fingers
I'm in the zone

I don't want her if that ass don't sit like a horse
I be ballin' on these niggas, got me feelin' like sports
Dash got so much wood I could build me a fort
Ain't too many things I ain't done yet

I'm just barely gettin' started, you already upset
Got a tiger as a pet, I just took him to the vet
Homie, I be makin' hits, I'm the rap Derek Jeter
Let your bitch ride on me like she was on the feeder
If the pussy ain't good then I probably won't feed her
Lil homie, you can keep her cause I really don't need her
I ain't worried 'bout features, homeboy, you's a peon
Toilet seat ass nigga, man, I swear you gettin' peed on
Man, my jewelry so cold, I walk around with the heat on
My alarm clock set, just in case they wanna sleep on, ya dig?
I'm a full-time player, hoppin' out in alligator
Sippin' lean and Now and Later, homie, I'll annihilate ya
If you think you wanna battle, you gon' have to pay some paper
I just hit her and I quit her, I would never ever date her
It's a shame how I'm barely gettin' love in the city
Travel to another town, you can bet they fuckin' with me
I be killin' this shit, pray to God they forgive me
They said, ""when you blow up, don't forget me"", man
I been on fire ever since they made the lighter
My boys will pull up on ya, homie, I ain't talkin' diapers
Walk into your function, on point, I'm like a sniper
My girl bad like Dej Loaf so don't try her
Flexin' all you want but homeboy, you ain't ready

Unaware of my trajectory
I be susceptible to the pain I'm heavily affected
By the thoughts of if I'll make it
Where I'm gonna fit in
May end up a dead end but fuck it I'll live in

Rapping till I got more millions than Brewster

2015,Fight Song,Rachel Platten,"[Refrain]
Like a small boat on the ocean
Sending big waves into motion
Like how a single word
Can make a heart open
I might only have one match
But I can make an explosion

[Pre-Chorus]
And all those things I didn't say
Were wrecking balls inside my brain
I will scream them loud tonight
Can you hear my voice this time?

[Chorus]
This is my fight song (Hey)
Take back my life song (Hey)
Prove I'm alright song (Hey, ha)
My power's turned on (Hey)
Starting right now, I'll be strong (Hey)
I'll play my fight song (Hey)
And I don't really care if nobody else believes (Ha)
'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me

[Verse]
Losing friends and I'm chasing sleep
Everybody's worried about me
In too deep, say I'm in too deep (In too deep)
And it's been two years, I miss my home (I miss my home)
But there's a fire burning in my bones (In my bones)
Still believe, yeah, I still believe

Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
""Oh, my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?"" Ayy
New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So, hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, mm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the king, baby, I'm your queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh, no
Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing, like
""Oh, my God, who is she?""
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever

You can tell me when it's over, mm

The love that you gave me was so way down south
Baby I was born just to kiss your mouth

Was off for a sec, now it's back to me, nigga, you mad at me
This ain't what I want, man, this what it had to be
This is that late night working after three, man
This is why my old girl was mad at me
This why I'm your majesty, man
The clique is the tightest, the pussy the tightest
The drinks are the coldest, the future the brightest
The feat not divided, the love is divided
And I just gotta thank God that we got it
Blessed
I don't know what I would do without it
Crew look like we robbed a bank, but all we make is deposits
Your prophet will profit, oh God

Look, I ain't gon' say that we back or nothing
‘Cause that implies that we're back from something
If we're back from somethin' there's some checks you owe us
I expect that payment, nothing less or over
I don't need them favors that you ask me for
I could give two fucks 'bout where the Grammys go
I just gave out Grammys on my Instagram
Them OVO boys, the business man
It is what it is, trust me, you get what you give, yeah
You gotta come to my side and see how we live, yeah
I cannot see Heaven being much better than this, yeah
Blessings on blessings for me and my niggas from the 6
Look at what we did, yeah
Be quiet, I'm doing a toast
For niggas that don't really do shit, I swear, y'all be doing the most
Stop worrying 'bout whoever's next
I am just worried 'bout my mama worrying less
I think I'm famous enough
I don't need any more press
I am convinced I'm the only one left that's still doing this shit, man

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
My grandma just died, I'm the man of the house
So every morning I'm up 'cause I can't let them down, down
Always down for the cause, never down for the count
I guess when your stars align
You do like the solar system and plan it out
So I'm going over time, on the overtime
Yeah, I'm that invested, but you can't attest it
Million dollar goals, managed to manifest it
The family never going anorexic
I pay my own mortgage and electric
Never going under even with anesthetics
At the top of the rap game and progressin'
Check after check, checking off my check list
Try and blow my cake, just know that's a death wish
No mistakes in life ever, it's only lessons
Shit feel like Shaq and Penny got back together
You tore the game apart, who put it back together? I

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
Since the truth keep niggas traumatized
They tryna compromise my condom size
So I Snapchat that whole shit
Tryna see titties, tryna show dick
And I swear to God, I hope they post it, I'm blessed
Even though I get slammed with lawsuits like car doors
See three P.O.'s like Star Wars
They want me by the road holding up cardboard
So I go extra hard on the hard floor
Right now, I'm calling you from my home gym
Right after that, nigga, I'm gon' swim
Just did a couple laps in my home pool
And my daughter right there getting home-schooled, I'm blessed
And I was thinking 'bout starting up my own school, a Montessori
And the hallway looking like a monastery, oh, yes

2015,Take Me To Church,Hozier,"[Verse 1]
My lover's got humour
She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshipped her sooner
If the heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's gettin' more bleak
A fresh poison each week
We were born sick, you heard them say it
My church offers no absolutes
She tells me, ""Worship in the bedroom""
The only heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you
I was born sick, but I love it
Command me to be well

[Pre-Chorus]
A, amen
Amen, amen

[Chorus]
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life

What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starvin' faithful
That looks tasty, that looks plenty
This is hungry work

There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin

That one day I will be where I was
Right there, right next to you

2015,Old Man,Sawyer Fredericks,"                                        The Barricade

He was abruptly roused from sleep by the noise of a discharge of musketry; and, in spite of Rosanette's entreaties, Frederick was fully determined to go and see what was happening. He hurried down to the Champs-Elysées, from which shots were being fired. At the corner of the Rue Saint-Honoré some men in blouses ran past him, exclaiming:

""No! not that way! to the Palais-Royal!""

Frederick followed them. The grating of the Convent of the Assumption had been torn away. A little further on he noticed three paving-stones in the middle of the street, the beginning of a barricade, no doubt; then fragments of bottles and bundles of iron-wire, to obstruct the cavalry; and, at the same moment, there rushed suddenly out of a lane a tall young man of pale complexion, with his black hair flowing over his shoulders, and with a sort of pea-coloured swaddling-cloth thrown round him. In his hand he held a long military musket, and he dashed along on the tips of his slippers with the air of a somnambulist and with the nimbleness of a tiger. At intervals a detonation could be heard.

On the evening of the day before, the spectacle of the wagon containing five corpses picked up from amongst those that were lying on the Boulevard des Capucines had charged the disposition of the people; and, while at the Tuileries the aides-de-camp succeeded each other, and M. Molé, having set about the composition of a new Cabinet, did not come back, and M. Thiers was making efforts to constitute another, and while the King was cavilling and hesitating, and finally assigned the post of commander-in-chief to Bugeaud in order to prevent him from making use of it, the insurrection was organising itself in a formidable manner, as if it were directed by a single arm.

Men endowed with a kind of frantic eloquence were engaged in haranguing the populace at the street-corners, others were in the churches ringing the tocsin as loudly as ever they could. Lead was cast for bullets, cartridges were rolled about. The trees on the boulevards, the urinals, the benches, the gratings, the gas-burners, everything was torn off and thrown down. Paris, that morning, was covered with barricades. The resistance which was offered was of short duration, so that at eight o'clock the people, by voluntary surrender or by force, had got possession of five barracks, nearly all the municipal buildings, the most favourable strategic points. Of its own accord, without any effort, the Monarchy was melting away in rapid dissolution, and now an attack was made on the guard-house of the Château d'Eau, in order to liberate fifty prisoners, who were not there.

Frederick was forced to stop at the entrance to the square. It was filled with groups of armed men. The Rue Saint-Thomas and the Rue Fromanteau were occupied by companies of the Line. The Rue de Valois was choked up by an enormous barricade. The smoke which fluttered about at the top of it partly opened. Men kept running overhead, making violent gestures; they vanished from sight; then the firing was again renewed. It was answered from the guard-house without anyone being seen inside. Its windows, protected by oaken window-shutters, were pierced with loop-holes; and the monument with its two storys, its two wings, its fountain on the first floor and its little door in the centre, was beginning to be speckled with white spots under the shock of the bullets. The three steps in front of it remained unoccupied.

At Frederick's side a man in a Greek cap, with a cartridge-box over his knitted vest, was holding a dispute with a woman with a Madras neckerchief round her shoulders. She said to him:

""Come back now! Come back!""

""Leave me alone!"" replied the husband. ""You can easily mind the porter's lodge by yourself. I ask, citizen, is this fair? I have on every occasion done my duty—in 1830, in '32, in '34, and in '39! To-day they're fighting again. I must fight! Go away!""

And the porter's wife ended by yielding to his remonstrances and to those of a National Guard near them—a man of forty, whose simple face was adorned with a circle of white beard. He loaded his gun and fired while talking to Frederick, as cool in the midst of the outbreak as a horticulturist in his garden. A young lad with a packing-cloth thrown over him was trying to coax this man to give him a few caps, so that he might make use of a gun he had, a fine fowling-piece which a ""gentleman"" had made him a present of.

""Catch on behind my back,"" said the good man, ""and keep yourself from being seen, or you'll get yourself killed!""

The drums beat for the charge. Sharp cries, hurrahs of triumph burst forth. A continual ebbing to and fro made the multitude sway backward and forward. Frederick, caught between two thick masses of people, did not move an inch, all the time fascinated and exceedingly amused by the scene around him. The wounded who sank to the ground, the dead lying at his feet, did not seem like persons really wounded or really dead. The impression left on his mind was that he was looking on at a show.
In the midst of the surging throng, above the sea of heads, could be seen an old man in a black coat, mounted on a white horse with a velvet saddle. He held in one hand a green bough, in the other a paper, and he kept shaking them persistently; but at length, giving up all hope of obtaining a hearing, he withdrew from the scene.

The soldiers of the Line had gone, and only the municipal troops remained to defend the guard-house. A wave of dauntless spirits dashed up the steps; they were flung down; others came on to replace them, and the gate resounded under blows from iron bars. The municipal guards did not give way. But a wagon, stuffed full of hay, and burning like a gigantic torch, was dragged against the walls. Faggots were speedily brought, then straw, and a barrel of spirits of wine. The fire mounted up to the stones along the wall; the building began to send forth smoke on all sides like the crater of a volcano; and at its summit, between the balustrades of the terrace, huge flames escaped with a harsh noise. The first story of the Palais-Royal was occupied by National Guards. Shots were fired through every window in the square; the bullets whizzed, the water of the fountain, which had burst, was mingled with the blood, forming little pools on the ground. People slipped in the mud over clothes, shakos, and weapons. Frederick felt something soft under his foot. It was the hand of a sergeant in a grey great-coat, lying on his face in the stream that ran along the street. Fresh bands of people were continually coming up, pushing on the combatants at the guard-house. The firing became quicker. The wine-shops were open; people went into them from time to time to smoke a pipe and drink a glass of beer, and then came back again to fight. A lost dog began to howl. This made the people laugh.

Frederick was shaken by the impact of a man falling on his shoulder with a bullet through his back and the death-rattle in his throat. At this shot, perhaps directed against himself, he felt himself stirred up to rage; and he was plunging forward when a National Guard stopped him.

""'Tis useless! the King has just gone! Ah! if you don't believe me, go and see for yourself!""

This assurance calmed Frederick. The Place du Carrousel had a tranquil aspect. The Hôtel de Nantes stood there as fixed as ever; and the houses in the rear; the dome of the Louvre in front, the long gallery of wood at the right, and the waste plot of ground that ran unevenly as far as the sheds of the stall-keepers were, so to speak, steeped in the grey hues of the atmosphere, where indistinct murmurs seemed to mingle with the fog; while, at the opposite side of the square, a stiff light, falling through the parting of the clouds on the façade of the Tuileries, cut out all its windows into white patches. Near the Arc de Triomphe a dead horse lay on the ground. Behind the gratings groups consisting of five or six persons were chatting. The doors leading into the château were open, and the servants at the thresholds allowed the people to enter.

Below stairs, in a kind of little parlour, bowls of café au lait were handed round. A few of those present sat down to the table and made merry; others remained standing, and amongst the latter was a hackney-coachman. He snatched up with both hands a glass vessel full of powdered sugar, cast a restless glance right and left, and then began to eat voraciously, with his nose stuck into the mouth of the vessel.

At the bottom of the great staircase a man was writing his name in a register.

Frederick was able to recognise him by his back.

""Hallo, Hussonnet!""

""Yes, 'tis I,"" replied the Bohemian. ""I am introducing myself at court. This is a nice joke, isn't it?""

""Suppose we go upstairs?""

And they reached presently the Salle des Maréchaux. The portraits of those illustrious generals, save that of Bugeaud, which had been pierced through the stomach, were all intact. They were represented leaning on their sabres with a gun-carriage behind each of them, and in formidable attitudes in contrast with the occasion. A large timepiece proclaimed it was twenty minutes past one.

Suddenly the ""Marseillaise"" resounded. Hussonnet and Frederick bent over the balusters. It was the people. They rushed up the stairs, shaking with a dizzying, wave-like motion bare heads, or helmets, or red caps, or else bayonets or human shoulders with such impetuosity that some people disappeared every now and then in this swarming mass, which was mounting up without a moment's pause, like a river compressed by an equinoctial tide, with a continuous roar under an irresistible impulse. When they got to the top of the stairs, they were scattered, and their chant died away. Nothing could any longer be heard but the tramp of all the shoes intermingled with the chopping sound of many voices. The crowd not being in a mischievous mood, contented themselves with looking about them. But, from time to time, an elbow, by pressing too hard, broke through a pane of glass, or else a vase or a statue rolled from a bracket down on the floor. The wainscotings cracked under the pressure of people against them. Every face was flushed; the perspiration was rolling down their features in large beads. Hussonnet made this remark:
""Heroes have not a good smell.""

""Ah! you are provoking,"" returned Frederick.

And, pushed forward in spite of themselves, they entered an apartment in which a dais of red velvet rose as far as the ceiling. On the throne below sat a representative of the proletariat in effigy with a black beard, his shirt gaping open, a jolly air, and the stupid look of a baboon. Others climbed up the platform to sit in his place.

""What a myth!"" said Hussonnet. ""There you see the sovereign people!""

The armchair was lifted up on the hands of a number of persons and passed across the hall, swaying from one side to the other.

""By Jove, 'tis like a boat! The Ship of State is tossing about in a stormy sea! Let it dance the cancan! Let it dance the cancan!""

They had drawn it towards a window, and in the midst of hisses, they launched it out.

""Poor old chap!"" said Hussonnet, as he saw the effigy falling into the garden, where it was speedily picked up in order to be afterwards carried to the Bastille and burned.

Then a frantic joy burst forth, as if, instead of the throne, a future of boundless happiness had appeared; and the people, less through a spirit of vindictiveness than to assert their right of possession, broke or tore the glasses, the curtains, the lustres, the tapers, the tables, the chairs, the stools, the entire furniture, including the very albums and engravings, and the corbels of the tapestry. Since they had triumphed, they must needs amuse themselves! The common herd ironically wrapped themselves up in laces and cashmeres. Gold fringes were rolled round the sleeves of blouses. Hats with ostriches' feathers adorned blacksmiths' heads, and ribbons of the Legion of Honour supplied waistbands for prostitutes. Each person satisfied his or her caprice; some danced, others drank. In the queen's apartment a woman gave a gloss to her hair with pomatum. Behind a folding-screen two lovers were playing cards. Hussonnet pointed out to Frederick an individual who was smoking a dirty pipe with his elbows resting on a balcony; and the popular frenzy redoubled with a continuous crash of broken porcelain and pieces of crystal, which, as they rebounded, made sounds resembling those produced by the plates of musical glasses.

Then their fury was overshadowed. A nauseous curiosity made them rummage all the dressing-rooms, all the recesses. Returned convicts thrust their arms into the beds in which princesses had slept, and rolled themselves on the top of them, to console themselves for not being able to embrace their owners. Others, with sinister faces, roamed about silently, looking for something to steal, but too great a multitude was there. Through the bays of the doors could be seen in the suite of apartments only the dark mass of people between the gilding of the walls under a cloud of dust. Every breast was panting. The heat became more and more suffocating; and the two friends, afraid of being stifled, seized the opportunity of making their way out.

In the antechamber, standing on a heap of garments, appeared a girl of the town as a statue of Liberty, motionless, her grey eyes wide open—a fearful sight.

They had taken three steps outside the château when a company of the National Guards, in great-coats, advanced towards them, and, taking off their foraging-caps, and, at the same time, uncovering their skulls, which were slightly bald, bowed very low to the people. At this testimony of respect, the ragged victors bridled up. Hussonnet and Frederick were not without experiencing a certain pleasure from it as well as the rest.

They were filled with ardour. They went back to the Palais-Royal. In front of the Rue Fromanteau, soldiers' corpses were heaped up on the straw. They passed close to the dead without a single quiver of emotion, feeling a certain pride in being able to keep their countenance.
The Palais overflowed with people. In the inner courtyard seven piles of wood were flaming. Pianos, chests of drawers, and clocks were hurled out through the windows. Fire-engines sent streams of water up to the roofs. Some vagabonds tried to cut the hose with their sabres. Frederick urged a pupil of the Polytechnic School to interfere. The latter did not understand him, and, moreover, appeared to be an idiot. All around, in the two galleries, the populace, having got possession of the cellars, gave themselves up to a horrible carouse. Wine flowed in streams and wetted people's feet; the mudlarks drank out of the tail-ends of the bottles, and shouted as they staggered along.

""Come away out of this,"" said Hussonnet; ""I am disgusted with the people.""

All over the Orléans Gallery the wounded lay on mattresses on the ground, with purple curtains folded round them as coverlets; and the small shopkeepers' wives and daughters from the quarter brought them broth and linen.

""No matter!"" said Frederick; ""for my part, I consider the people sublime.""

The great vestibule was filled with a whirlwind of furious individuals. Men tried to ascend to the upper storys in order to put the finishing touches to the work of wholesale destruction. National Guards, on the steps, strove to keep them back. The most intrepid was a chasseur, who had his head bare, his hair bristling, and his straps in pieces. His shirt caused a swelling between his trousers and his coat, and he struggled desperately in the midst of the others. Hussonnet, who had sharp sight, recognised Arnoux from a distance.

Then they went into the Tuileries garden, so as to be able to breathe more freely. They sat down on a bench; and they remained for some minutes with their eyes closed, so much stunned that they had not the energy to say a word. The people who were passing came up to them and informed them that the Duchesse d'Orléans had been appointed Regent, and that it was all over. They were experiencing that species of comfort which follows rapid dénouements, when at the windows of the attics in the château appeared men-servants tearing their liveries to pieces. They flung their torn clothes into the garden, as a mark of renunciation. The people hooted at them, and then they retired.

The attention of Frederick and Hussonnet was distracted by a tall fellow who was walking quickly between the trees with a musket on his shoulder. A cartridge-box was pressed against his pea-jacket; a handkerchief was wound round his forehead under his cap. He turned his head to one side. It was Dussardier; and casting himself into their arms:

""Ah! what good fortune, my poor old friends!"" without being able to say another word, so much out of breath was he with fatigue.

He had been on his legs for the last twenty-four hours. He had been engaged at the barricades of the Latin Quarter, had fought in the Rue Rabuteau, had saved three dragoons' lives, had entered the Tuileries with Colonel Dunoyer, and, after that, had repaired to the Chamber, and then to the Hôtel de Ville.

""I have come from it! all goes well! the people are victorious! the workmen and the employers are embracing one another. Ha! if you knew what I have seen! what brave fellows! what a fine sight it was!""

And without noticing that they had no arms:

""I was quite certain of finding you there! This has been a bit rough—no matter!""

A drop of blood ran down his cheek, and in answer to the questions put to him by the two others:

""Oh! 'tis nothing! a slight scratch from a bayonet!""

""However, you really ought to take care of yourself.""

""Pooh! I am substantial! What does this signify? The Republic is proclaimed! We'll be happy henceforth! Some journalists, who were talking just now in front of me, said they were going to liberate Poland and Italy! No more kings! You understand? The entire land free! the entire land free!""

And with one comprehensive glance at the horizon, he spread out his arms in a triumphant attitude. But a long file of men rushed over the terrace on the water's edge.

""Ah, deuce take it! I was forgetting. I must be off. Good-bye!""

He turned round to cry out to them while brandishing his musket:

""Long live the Republic!""

From the chimneys of the château escaped enormous whirlwinds of black smoke which bore sparks along with them. The ringing of the bells sent out over the city a wild and startling alarm. Right and left, in every direction, the conquerors discharged their weapons.

Frederick, though he was not a warrior, felt the Gallic blood leaping in his veins. The magnetism of the public enthusiasm had seized hold of him. He inhaled with a voluptuous delight the stormy atmosphere filled with the odour of gunpowder; and, in the meantime, he quivered under the effluvium of an immense love, a supreme and universal tenderness, as if the heart of all humanity were throbbing in his breast.

Hussonnet said with a yawn:

""It would be time, perhaps, to go and instruct the populace.""

Frederick followed him to his correspondence-office in the Place de la Bourse; and he began to compose for the Troyes newspaper an account of recent events in a lyric style—a veritable tit-bit—to which he attached his signature. Then they dined together at a tavern. Hussonnet was pensive; the eccentricities of the Revolution exceeded his own.

After leaving the café, when they repaired to the Hôtel de Ville to learn the news, the boyish impulses which were natural to him had got the upper hand once more. He scaled the barricades like a chamois, and answered the sentinels with broad jokes of a patriotic flavour.

They heard the Provisional Government proclaimed by torchlight. At last, Frederick got back to his house at midnight, overcome with fatigue.

""Well,"" said he to his man-servant, while the latter was undressing him, ""are you satisfied?""

""Yes, no doubt, Monsieur; but I don't like to see the people dancing to music.""

Next morning, when he awoke, Frederick thought of Deslauriers. He hastened to his friend's lodgings. He ascertained that the advocate had just left Paris, having been appointed a provincial commissioner. At the soirée given the night before, he had got into contact with Ledru-Rollin, and laying siege to him in the name of the Law Schools, had snatched from him a post, a mission. However, the doorkeeper explained, he was going to write and give his address in the following week.

After this, Frederick went to see the Maréchale. She gave him a chilling reception. She resented his desertion of her. Her bitterness disappeared when he had given her repeated assurances that peace was restored.

All was quiet now. There was no reason to be afraid. He kissed her, and she declared herself in favour of the Republic, as his lordship the Archbishop of Paris had already done, and as the magistracy, the Council of State, the Institute, the marshals of France, Changarnier, M. de Falloux, all the Bonapartists, all the Legitimists, and a considerable number of Orléanists were about to do with a swiftness indicative of marvellous zeal.

The fall of the Monarchy had been so rapid that, as soon as the first stupefaction that succeeded it had passed away, there was amongst the middle class a feeling of astonishment at the fact that they were still alive. The summary execution of some thieves, who were shot without a trial, was regarded as an act of signal justice. For a month Lamartine's phrase was repeated with reference to the red flag, ""which had only gone the round of the Champ de Mars, while the tricoloured flag,"" etc.; and all ranged themselves under its shade, each party seeing amongst the three colours only its own, and firmly determined, as soon as it would be the most powerful, to tear away the two others.

As business was suspended, anxiety and love of gaping drove everyone into the open air. The careless style of costume generally adopted attenuated differences of social position. Hatred masked itself; expectations were openly indulged in; the multitude seemed full of good-nature. The pride of having gained their rights shone in the people's faces. They displayed the gaiety of a carnival, the manners of a bivouac. Nothing could be more amusing than the aspect of Paris during the first days that followed the Revolution.

Frederick gave the Maréchale his arm, and they strolled along through the streets together. She was highly diverted by the display of rosettes in every buttonhole, by the banners hung from every window, and the bills of every colour that were posted upon the walls, and threw some money here and there into the collection-boxes for the wounded, which were placed on chairs in the middle of the pathway. Then she stopped before some caricatures representing Louis Philippe as a pastry-cook, as a mountebank, as a dog, or as a leech. But she was a little frightened at the sight of Caussidière's men with their sabres and scarfs. At other times it was a tree of Liberty that was being planted. The clergy vied with each other in blessing the Republic, escorted by servants in gold lace; and the populace thought this very fine. The most frequent spectacle was that of deputations from no matter what, going to demand something at the Hôtel de Ville, for every trade, every industry, was looking to the Government to put a complete end to its wretchedness. Some of them, it is true, went to offer it advice or to congratulate it, or merely to pay it a little visit, and to see the machine performing its functions. One day, about the middle of the month of March, as they were passing the Pont d'Arcole, having to do some commission for Rosanette in the Latin Quarter, Frederick saw approaching a column of individuals with oddly-shaped hats and long beards. At its head, beating a drum, walked a negro who had formerly been an artist's model; and the man who bore the banner, on which this inscription floated in the wind, ""Artist-Painters,"" was no other than Pellerin.

He made a sign to Frederick to wait for him, and then reappeared five minutes afterwards, having some time before him; for the Government was, at that moment, receiving a deputation from the stone-cutters. He was going with his colleagues to ask for the creation of a Forum of Art, a kind of Exchange where the interests of Æsthetics would be discussed. Sublime masterpieces would be produced, inasmuch as the workers would amalgamate their talents. Ere long Paris would be covered with gigantic monuments. He would decorate them. He had even begun a figure of the Republic. One of his comrades had come to take it, for they were closely pursued by the deputation from the poulterers.

""What stupidity!"" growled a voice in the crowd. ""Always some humbug, nothing strong!""

It was Regimbart. He did not salute Frederick, but took advantage of the occasion to give vent to his own bitterness.

The Citizen spent his days wandering about the streets, pulling his moustache, rolling his eyes about, accepting and propagating any dismal news that was communicated to him; and he had only two phrases: ""Take care! we're going to be run over!"" or else, ""Why, confound it! they're juggling with the Republic!"" He was discontented with everything, and especially with the fact that we had not taken back our natural frontiers.

The very name of Lamartine made him shrug his shoulders. He did not consider Ledru-Rollin ""sufficient for the problem,"" referred to Dupont (of the Eure) as an old numbskull, Albert as an idiot, Louis Blanc as an Utopist, and Blanqui as an exceedingly dangerous man; and when Frederick asked him what would be the best thing to do, he replied, pressing his arm till he nearly bruised it:

""To take the Rhine, I tell you! to take the Rhine, damn it!""

Then he blamed the Reactionaries. They were taking off the mask. The sack of the château of Neuilly and Suresne, the fire at Batignolles, the troubles at Lyons, all the excesses and all the grievances, were just now being exaggerated by having superadded to them Ledru-Rollin's circular, the forced currency of bank-notes, the fall of the funds to sixty francs, and, to crown all, as the supreme iniquity, a final blow, a culminating horror, the duty of forty-five centimes! And over and above all these things, there was again Socialism! Although these theories, as new as the game of goose, had been discussed sufficiently for forty years to fill a number of libraries, they terrified the wealthier citizens, as if they had been a hailstorm of aërolites; and they expressed indignation at them by virtue of that hatred which the advent of every idea provokes, simply because it is an idea—an odium from which it derives subsequently its glory, and which causes its enemies to be always beneath it, however lowly it may be.

Then Property rose in their regard to the level of Religion, and was confounded with God. The attacks made on it appeared to them a sacrilege; almost a species of cannibalism. In spite of the most humane legislation that ever existed, the spectre of '93 reappeared, and the chopper of the guillotine vibrated in every syllable of the word ""Republic,"" which did not prevent them from despising it for its weakness. France, no longer feeling herself mistress of the situation, was beginning to shriek with terror, like a blind man without his stick or an infant that had lost its nurse.

Of all Frenchmen, M. Dambreuse was the most alarmed. The new condition of things threatened his fortune, but, more than anything else, it deceived his experience. A system so good! a king so wise! was it possible? The ground was giving way beneath their feet! Next morning he dismissed three of his servants, sold his horses, bought a soft hat to go out into the streets, thought even of letting his beard grow; and he remained at home, prostrated, reading over and over again newspapers most hostile to his own ideas, and plunged into such a gloomy mood that even the jokes about the pipe of Flocon[F] had not the power to make him smile.

As a supporter of the last reign, he was dreading the vengeance of the people so far as concerned his estates in Champagne when Frederick's lucubration fell into his hands. Then it occurred to his mind that his young friend was a very useful personage, and that he might be able, if not to serve him, at least to protect him, so that, one morning, M. Dambreuse presented himself at Frederick's residence, accompanied by Martinon.

This visit, he said, had no object save that of seeing him for a little while, and having a chat with him. In short, he rejoiced at the events that had happened, and with his whole heart adopted ""our sublime motto, Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity,"" having always been at bottom a Republican. If he voted under the other régime with the Ministry, it was simply in order to accelerate an inevitable downfall. He even inveighed against M. Guizot, ""who has got us into a nice hobble, we must admit!"" By way of retaliation, he spoke in an enthusiastic fashion about Lamartine, who had shown himself ""magnificent, upon my word of honour, when, with reference to the red flag——""

""Yes, I know,"" said Frederick. After which he declared that his sympathies were on the side of the working-men.

""For, in fact, more or less, we are all working-men!"" And he carried his impartiality so far as to acknowledge that Proudhon had a certain amount of logic in his views. ""Oh, a great deal of logic, deuce take it!""

Then, with the disinterestedness of a superior mind, he chatted about the exhibition of pictures, at which he had seen Pellerin's work. He considered it original and well-painted.

Martinon backed up all he said with expressions of approval; and likewise was of his opinion that it was necessary to rally boldly to the side of the Republic. And he talked about the husbandman, his father, and assumed the part of the peasant, the man of the people. They soon came to the question of the elections for the National Assembly, and the candidates in the arrondissement of La Fortelle. The Opposition candidate had no chance.

""You should take his place!"" said M. Dambreuse.

Frederick protested.

""But why not?"" For he would obtain the suffrages of the Extremists owing to his personal opinions, and that of the Conservatives on account of his family; ""And perhaps also,"" added the banker, with a smile, ""thanks to my influence, in some measure.""

Frederick urged as an obstacle that he did not know how to set about it.

There was nothing easier if he only got himself recommended to the patriots of the Aube by one of the clubs of the capital. All he had to do was to read out, not a profession of faith such as might be seen every day, but a serious statement of principles.

""Bring it to me; I know what goes down in the locality; and you can, I say again, render great services to the country—to us all—to myself.""

In such times people ought to aid each other, and, if Frederick had need of anything, he or his friends——

""Oh, a thousand thanks, my dear Monsieur!""

""You'll do as much for me in return, mind!""

Decidedly, the banker was a decent man.

Frederick could not refrain from pondering over his advice; and soon he was dazzled by a kind of dizziness.

The great figures of the Convention passed before his mental vision. It seemed to him that a splendid dawn was about to rise. Rome, Vienna and Berlin were in a state of insurrection, and the Austrians had been driven out of Venice. All Europe was agitated. Now was the time to make a plunge into the movement, and perhaps to accelerate it; and then he was fascinated by the costume which it was said the deputies would wear. Already he saw himself in a waistcoat with lapels and a tricoloured sash; and this itching, this hallucination, became so violent that he opened his mind to Dambreuse.

The honest fellow's enthusiasm had not abated.

""Certainly—sure enough! Offer yourself!""

Frederick, nevertheless, consulted Deslauriers.

The idiotic opposition which trammelled the commissioner in his province had augmented his Liberalism. He at once replied, exhorting Frederick with the utmost vehemence to come forward as a candidate. However, as the latter was desirous of having the approval of a great number of persons, he confided the thing to Rosanette one day, when Mademoiselle Vatnaz happened to be present.

She was one of those Parisian spinsters who, every evening when they have given their lessons or tried to sell little sketches, or to dispose of poor manuscripts, return to their own homes with mud on their petticoats, make their own dinner, which they eat by themselves, and then, with their soles resting on a foot-warmer, by the light of a filthy lamp, dream of a love, a family, a hearth, wealth—all that they lack. So it was that, like many others, she had hailed in the Revolution the advent of vengeance, and she delivered herself up to a Socialistic propaganda of the most unbridled description.

The enfranchisement of the proletariat, according to the Vatnaz, was only possible by the enfranchisement of woman. She wished to have her own sex admitted to every kind of employment, to have an enquiry made into the paternity of children, a different code, the abolition, or at least a more intelligent regulation, of marriage. In that case every Frenchwoman would be bound to marry a Frenchman, or to adopt an old man. Nurses and midwives should be officials receiving salaries from the State.

There should be a jury to examine the works of women, special editors for women, a polytechnic school for women, a National Guard for women, everything for women! And, since the Government ignored their rights, they ought to overcome force by force. Ten thousand citizenesses with good guns ought to make the Hôtel de Ville quake!

Frederick's candidature appeared to her favourable for carrying out her ideas. She encouraged him, pointing out the glory that shone on the horizon. Rosanette was delighted at the notion of having a man who would make speeches at the Chamber.

""And then, perhaps, they'll give you a good place?""

Frederick, a man prone to every kind of weakness, was infected by the universal mania. He wrote an address and went to show it to M. Dambreuse.

At the sound made by the great door falling back, a curtain gaped open a little behind a casement, and a woman appeared at it He had not time to find out who she was; but, in the anteroom, a picture arrested his attention—Pellerin's picture—which lay on a chair, no doubt provisionally.

It represented the Republic, or Progress, or Civilisation, under the form of Jesus Christ driving a locomotive, which was passing through a virgin forest. Frederick, after a minute's contemplation, exclaimed:

""What a vile thing!""

""Is it not—eh?"" said M. Dambreuse, coming in unexpectedly just at the moment when the other was giving utterance to this opinion, and fancying that it had reference, not so much to the picture as to the doctrine glorified by the work. Martinon presented himself at the same time. They made their way into the study, and Frederick was drawing a paper out of his pocket, when Mademoiselle Cécile, entering suddenly, said, articulating her words in an ingenuous fashion:

""Is my aunt here?""

""You know well she is not,"" replied the banker. ""No matter! act as if you were at home, Mademoiselle.""

""Oh! thanks! I am going away!""

Scarcely had she left when Martinon seemed to be searching for his handkerchief.

""I forgot to take it out of my great-coat—excuse me!""

""All right!"" said M. Dambreuse.

Evidently he was not deceived by this manœuvre, and even seemed to regard it with favour. Why? But Martinon soon reappeared, and Frederick began reading his address.

At the second page, which pointed towards the preponderance of the financial interests as a disgraceful fact, the banker made a grimace. Then, touching on reforms, Frederick demanded free trade.

""What? Allow me, now!""

The other paid no attention, and went on. He called for a tax on yearly incomes, a progressive tax, a European federation, and the education of the people, the encouragement of the fine arts on the liberal scale.

""When the country could provide men like Delacroix or Hugo with incomes of a hundred thousand francs, where would be the harm?""

At the close of the address advice was given to the upper classes.

""Spare nothing, ye rich; but give! give!""

He stopped, and remained standing. The two who had been listening to him did not utter a word. Martinon opened his eyes wide; M. Dambreuse was quite pale. At last, concealing his emotion under a bitter smile:

""That address of yours is simply perfect!"" And he praised the style exceedingly in order to avoid giving his opinion as to the matter of the address.

This virulence on the part of an inoffensive young man frightened him, especially as a sign of the times.

Martinon tried to reassure him. The Conservative party, in a little while, would certainly be able to take its revenge. In several cities the commissioners of the provisional government had been driven away; the elections were not to occur till the twenty-third of April; there was plenty of time. In short, it was necessary for M. Dambreuse to present himself personally in the Aube; and from that time forth, Martinon no longer left his side, became his secretary, and was as attentive to him as any son could be.

Frederick arrived at Rosanette's house in a very self-complacent mood. Delmar happened to be there, and told him of his intention to stand as a candidate at the Seine elections. In a placard addressed to the people, in which he addressed them in the familiar manner which one adopts towards an individual, the actor boasted of being able to understand them, and of having, in order to save them, got himself ""crucified for the sake of art,"" so that he was the incarnation, the ideal of the popular spirit, believing that he had, in fact, such enormous power over the masses that he proposed by-and-by, when he occupied a ministerial office, to quell any outbreak by himself alone; and, with regard to the means he would employ, he gave this answer: ""Never fear! I'll show them my head!""

Frederick, in order to mortify him, gave him to understand that he was himself a candidate. The mummer, from the moment that his future colleague aspired to represent the province, declared himself his servant, and offered to be his guide to the various clubs.

They visited them, or nearly all, the red and the blue, the furious and the tranquil, the puritanical and the licentious, the mystical and the intemperate, those that had voted for the death of kings, and those in which the frauds in the grocery trade had been denounced; and everywhere the tenants cursed the landlords; the blouse was full of spite against broadcloth; and the rich conspired against the poor. Many wanted indemnities on the ground that they had formerly been martyrs of the police; others appealed for money in order to carry out certain inventions, or else there were plans of phalansteria, projects for cantonal bazaars, systems of public felicity; then, here and there a flash of genius amid these clouds of folly, sudden as splashes, the law formulated by an oath, and flowers of eloquence on the lips of some soldier-boy, with a shoulder-belt strapped over his bare, shirtless chest. Sometimes, too, a gentleman made his appearance—an aristocrat of humble demeanour, talking in a plebeian strain, and with his hands unwashed, so as to make them look hard. A patriot recognised him; the most virtuous mobbed him; and he went off with rage in his soul. On the  pretext of good sense, it was desirable to be always disparaging the advocates, and to make use as often as possible of these expressions: ""To carry his stone to the building,"" ""social problem,"" ""workshop.""

Delmar did not miss the opportunities afforded him for getting in a word; and when he no longer found anything to say, his device was to plant himself in some conspicuous position with one of his arms akimbo and the other in his waistcoat, turning himself round abruptly in profile, so as to give a good view of his head. Then there were outbursts of applause, which came from Mademoiselle Vatnaz at the lower end of the hall.

Frederick, in spite of the weakness of orators, did not dare to try the experiment of speaking. All those people seemed to him too unpolished or too hostile.

But Dussardier made enquiries, and informed him that there existed in the Rue Saint-Jacques a club which bore the name of the ""Club of Intellect."" Such a name gave good reason for hope. Besides, he would bring some friends there.

He brought those whom he had invited to take punch with him—the bookkeeper, the traveller in wines, and the architect; even Pellerin had offered to come, and Hussonnet would probably form one of the party, and on the footpath before the door stood Regimbart, with two individuals, the first of whom was his faithful Compain, a rather thick-set man marked with small-pox and with bloodshot eyes; and the second, an ape-like negro, exceedingly hairy, and whom he knew only in the character of ""a patriot from Barcelona.""

They passed though a passage, and were then introduced into a large room, no doubt used by a joiner, and with walls still fresh and smelling of plaster. Four argand lamps were hanging parallel to each other, and shed an unpleasant light. On a platform, at the end of the room, there was a desk with a bell; underneath it a table, representing the rostrum, and on each side two others, somewhat lower, for the secretaries. The audience that adorned the benches consisted of old painters of daubs, ushers, and literary men who could not get their works published.

In the midst of those lines of paletots with greasy collars could be seen here and there a woman's cap or a workman's linen smock. The bottom of the apartment was even full of workmen, who had in all likelihood come there to pass away an idle hour, and who had been introduced by some speakers in order that they might applaud.

Frederick took care to place himself between Dussardier and Regimbart, who was scarcely seated when he leaned both hands on his walking-stick and his chin on his hands and shut his eyes, whilst at the other end of the room Delmar stood looking down at the assembly. Sénécal appeared at the president's desk.

The worthy bookkeeper thought Frederick would be pleased at this unexpected discovery. It only annoyed him.

The meeting exhibited great respect for the president. He was one who, on the twenty-fifth of February, had desired an immediate organisation of labour. On the following day, at the Prado, he had declared himself in favour attacking the Hôtel de Ville; and, as every person at that period took some model for imitation, one copied Saint-Just, another Danton, another Marat; as for him, he tried to be like Blanqui, who imitated Robespierre. His black gloves, and his hair brushed back, gave him a rigid aspect exceedingly becoming.

He opened the proceedings with the declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen—a customary act of faith. Then, a vigorous voice struck up Béranger's ""Souvenirs du Peuple.""

Other voices were raised:

""No! no! not that!""

""'La Casquette!'"" the patriots at the bottom of the apartment began to howl.

And they sang in chorus the favourite lines of the period:

""Doff your hat before my cap—
Kneel before the working-man!""
At a word from the president the audience became silent.

One of the secretaries proceeded to inspect the letters.

Some young men announced that they burned a number of the Assemblée Nationale every evening in front of the Panthéon, and they urged on all patriots to follow their example.

""Bravo! adopted!"" responded the audience.

The Citizen Jean Jacques Langreneux, a printer in the Rue Dauphin, would like to have a monument raised to the memory of the martyrs of Thermidor.

Michel Evariste Népomucène, ex-professor, gave expression to the wish that the European democracy should adopt unity of language. A dead language might be used for that purpose—as, for example, improved Latin.

""No; no Latin!"" exclaimed the architect.

""Why?"" said the college-usher.

And these two gentlemen engaged in a discussion, in which the others also took part, each putting in a word of his own for effect; and the conversation on this topic soon became so tedious that many went away. But a little old man, who wore at the top of his prodigiously high forehead a pair of green spectacles, asked permission to speak in order to make an important communication.

It was a memorandum on the assessment of taxes. The figures flowed on in a continuous stream, as if they were never going to end. The impatience of the audience found vent at first in murmurs, in whispered talk. He allowed nothing to put him out. Then they began hissing; they catcalled him. Sénécal called the persons who were interrupting to order. The orator went on like a machine. It was necessary to catch him by the shoulder in order to stop him. The old fellow looked as if he were waking out of a dream, and, placidly lifting his spectacles, said:

""Pardon me, citizens! pardon me! I am going—a thousand excuses!""

Frederick was disconcerted with the failure of the old man's attempts to read this written statement. He had his own address in his pocket, but an extemporaneous speech would have been preferable.

Finally the president announced that they were about to pass on to the important matter, the electoral question. They would not discuss the big Republican lists. However, the ""Club of Intellect"" had every right, like every other, to form one, ""with all respect for the pachas of the Hôtel de Ville,"" and the citizens who solicited the popular mandate might set forth their claims.

""Go on, now!"" said Dussardier.

A man in a cassock, with woolly hair and a petulant expression on his face, had already raised his hand. He said, with a stutter, that his name was Ducretot, priest and agriculturist, and that he was the author of a work entitled ""Manures."" He was told to send it to a horticultural club.

Then a patriot in a blouse climbed up into the rostrum. He was a plebeian, with broad shoulders, a big face, very mild-looking, with long black hair. He cast on the assembly an almost voluptuous glance, flung back his head, and, finally, spreading out his arms:

""You have repelled Ducretot, O my brothers! and you have done right; but it was not through irreligion, for we are all religious.""

Many of those present listened open-mouthed, with the air of catechumens and in ecstatic attitudes.

""It is not either because he is a priest, for we, too, are priests! The workman is a priest, just as the founder of Socialism was—the Master of us all, Jesus Christ!""

The time had arrived to inaugurate the Kingdom of God. The Gospel led directly to '89. After the abolition of slavery, the abolition of the proletariat. They had had the age of hate—the age of love was about to begin.

""Christianity is the keystone and the foundation of the new edifice——""

""You are making game of us?"" exclaimed the traveller in wines. ""Who has given me such a priest's cap?""

This interruption gave great offence. Nearly all the audience got on benches, and, shaking their fists, shouted: ""Atheist! aristocrat! low rascal!"" whilst the president's bell kept ringing continuously, and the cries of ""Order! order!"" redoubled. But, aimless, and, moreover, fortified by three cups of coffee which he had swallowed before coming to the meeting, he struggled in the midst of the others:

""What? I an aristocrat? Come, now!""

When, at length, he was permitted to give an explanation, he declared that he would never be at peace with the priests; and, since something had just been said about economical measures, it would be a splendid one to put an end to the churches, the sacred pyxes, and finally all creeds.

Somebody raised the objection that he was going very far.

""Yes! I am going very far! But, when a vessel is caught suddenly in a storm——""

Without waiting for the conclusion of this simile, another made a reply to his observation:

""Granted! But this is to demolish at a single stroke, like a mason devoid of judgment——""

""You are insulting the masons!"" yelled a citizen covered with plaster. And persisting in the belief that provocation had been offered to him, he vomited forth insults, and wished to fight, clinging tightly to the bench whereon he sat. It took no less than three men to put him out.

Meanwhile the workman still remained on the rostrum. The two secretaries gave him an intimation that he should come down. He protested against the injustice done to him.

""You shall not prevent me from crying out, 'Eternal love to our dear France! eternal love all to the Republic!'""

""Citizens!"" said Compain, after this—""Citizens!""

And, by dint of repeating ""Citizens,"" having obtained a little silence, he leaned on the rostrum with his two red hands, which looked like stumps, bent forward his body, and blinking his eyes:

""I believe that it would be necessary to give a larger extension to the calf's head.""

All who heard him kept silent, fancying that they had misunderstood his words.

""Yes! the calf's head!""

Three hundred laughs burst forth at the same time. The ceiling shook.

At the sight of all these faces convulsed with mirth, Compain shrank back. He continued in an angry tone:

""What! you don't know what the calf's head is!""

It was a paroxysm, a delirium. They held their sides. Some of them even tumbled off the benches to the ground with convulsions of laughter. Compain, not being able to stand it any longer, took refuge beside Regimbart, and wanted to drag him away.

""No! I am remaining till 'tis all over!"" said the Citizen.

This reply caused Frederick to make up his mind; and, as he looked about to the right and the left to see whether his friends were prepared to support him, he saw Pellerin on the rostrum in front of him.

The artist assumed a haughty tone in addressing the meeting.

""I would like to get some notion as to who is the candidate amongst all these that represents art. For my part, I have painted a picture.""

""We have nothing to do with painting pictures!"" was the churlish remark of a thin man with red spots on his cheek-bones.

Pellerin protested against this interruption.

But the other, in a tragic tone:

""Ought not the Government to make an ordinance abolishing prostitution and want?""

And this phrase having at once won to his side the popular favour, he thundered against the corruption of great cities.

""Shame and infamy! We ought to catch hold of wealthy citizens on their way out of the Maison d'Or and spit in their faces—unless it be that the Government countenances debauchery! But the collectors of the city dues exhibit towards our daughters and our sisters an amount of indecency——""

A voice exclaimed, some distance away:

""This is blackguard language! Turn him out!""

""They extract taxes from us to pay for licentiousness! Thus, the high salaries paid to actors——""

""Help!"" cried Pellerin.

He leaped from the rostrum, pushed everybody aside, and declaring that he regarded such stupid accusations with disgust, expatiated on the civilising mission of the player. Inasmuch as the theatre was the focus of national education, he would record his vote for the reform of the theatre; and to begin with, no more managements, no more privileges!

""Yes; of any sort!""

The actor's performance excited the audience, and people moved backwards and forwards knocking each other down.

""No more academies! No more institutes!""

""No missions!""

""No more bachelorships! Down with University degrees!""

""Let us preserve them,"" said Sénécal; ""but let them be conferred by universal suffrage, by the people, the only true judge!""

Besides, these things were not the most useful. It was necessary to take a level which would be above the heads of the wealthy. And he represented them as gorging themselves with crimes under their gilded ceilings; while the poor, writhing in their garrets with famine, cultivated every virtue. The applause became so vehement that he interrupted his discourse. For several minutes he remained with his eyes closed, his head thrown back, and, as it were, lulling himself to sleep over the fury which he had aroused.

Then he began to talk in a dogmatic fashion, in phrases as imperious as laws. The State should take possession of the banks and of the insurance offices. Inheritances should be abolished. A social fund should be established for the workers. Many other measures were desirable in the future. For the time being, these would suffice, and, returning to the question of the elections: ""We want pure citizens, men entirely fresh. Let some one offer himself.""

Frederick arose. There was a buzz of approval made by his friends. But Sénécal, assuming the attitude of a Fouquier-Tinville, began to ask questions as to his Christian name and surname, his antecedents, life, and morals.

Frederick answered succinctly, and bit his lips. Sénécal asked whether anyone saw any impediment to this candidature.

""No! no!""

But, for his part, he saw some. All around him bent forward and strained their ears to listen. The citizen who was seeking for their support had not delivered a certain sum promised by him for the foundation of a democratic journal. Moreover, on the twenty-second of February, though he had had sufficient notice on the subject, he had failed to be at the meeting-place in the Place de Panthéon.

""I swear that he was at the Tuileries!"" exclaimed Dussardier.

""Can you swear to having seen him at the Panthéon?""

Dussardier hung down his head. Frederick was silent. His friends, scandalised, regarded him with disquietude.

""In any case,"" Sénécal went on, ""do you know a patriot who will answer to us for your principles?""

""I will!"" said Dussardier.

""Oh! this is not enough; another!""

Frederick turned round to Pellerin. The artist replied to him with a great number of gestures, which meant:

""Ah! my dear boy, they have rejected myself! The deuce! What would you have?""

Thereupon Frederick gave Regimbart a nudge.

""Yes, that's true; 'tis time! I'm going.""

And Regimbart stepped upon the platform; then, pointing towards the Spaniard, who had followed him:

""Allow me, citizens, to present to you a patriot from Barcelona!""

The patriot made a low bow, rolled his gleaming eyes about, and with his hand on his heart:

""Ciudadanos! mucho aprecio el honor that you have bestowed on me! however great may be vuestra bondad, mayor vuestra atención!""

""I claim the right to speak!"" cried Frederick.

""Desde que se proclamo la constitutión de Cadiz, ese pacto fundamental of las libertades Españolas, hasta la ultima revolución, nuestra patria cuenta numerosos y heroicos mártires.""

Frederick once more made an effort to obtain a hearing:

""But, citizens!—--""

The Spaniard went on: ""El martes proximo tendra lugar en la iglesia de la Magdelena un servicio fúnebre.""

""In fact, this is ridiculous! Nobody understands him!""

This observation exasperated the audience.

""Turn him out! Turn him out!""

""Who? I?"" asked Frederick.

""Yourself!"" said Sénécal, majestically. ""Out with you!""

He rose to leave, and the voice of the Iberian pursued him:

""Y todos los Españoles descarien ver alli reunidas las disputaciónes de los clubs y de la milicia nacional. An oración fúnebre en honour of the libertad Española y del mundo entero will be prononciado por un miembro del clero of Paris en la sala Bonne Nouvelle. Honour al pueblo frances que llamaria yo el primero pueblo del mundo, sino fuese ciudadano de otra nación!""

""Aristo!"" screamed one blackguard, shaking his fist at Frederick, as the latter, boiling with indignation, rushed out into the yard adjoining the place where the meeting was held.

He reproached himself for his devotedness, without reflecting that, after all, the accusations brought against him were just.

What fatal idea was this candidature! But what asses! what idiots! He drew comparisons between himself and these men, and soothed his wounded pride with the thought of their stupidity.

Then he felt the need of seeing Rosanette. After such an exhibition of ugly traits, and so much magniloquence, her dainty person would be a source of relaxation. She was aware that he had intended to present himself at a club that evening. However, she did not even ask him a single question when he came in. She was sitting near the fire, ripping open the lining of a dress. He was surprised to find her thus occupied.

""Hallo! what are you doing?""

""You can see for yourself,"" said she, dryly. ""I am mending my clothes! So much for this Republic of yours!""

""Why do you call it mine?""

""Perhaps you want to make out that it's mine!""

And she began to upbraid him for everything that had happened in France for the last two months, accusing him of having brought about the Revolution and with having ruined her prospects by making everybody that had money leave Paris, and that she would by-and-by be dying in a hospital.

""It is easy for you to talk lightly about it, with your yearly income! However, at the rate at which things are going on, you won't have your yearly income long.""

""That may be,"" said Frederick. ""The most devoted are always misunderstood, and if one were not sustained by one's conscience, the brutes that you mix yourself up with would make you feel disgusted with your own self-denial!""

Rosanette gazed at him with knitted brows.

""Eh? What? What self-denial? Monsieur has not succeeded, it would seem? So much the better! It will teach you to make patriotic donations. Oh, don't lie! I know you have given them three hundred francs, for this Republic of yours has to be kept. Well, amuse yourself with it, my good man!""

Under this avalanche of abuse, Frederick passed from his former disappointment to a more painful disillusion.

He withdrew to the lower end of the apartment. She came up to him.

""Look here! Think it out a bit! In a country as in a house, there must be a master, otherwise, everyone pockets something out of the money spent. At first, everybody knows that Ledru-Rollin is head over ears in debt. As for Lamartine, how can you expect a poet to understand politics? Ah! 'tis all very well for you to shake your head and to presume that you have more brains than others; all the same, what I say is true! But you are always cavilling; a person can't get in a word with you! For instance, there's Fournier-Fontaine, who had stores at Saint-Roch! do you know how much he failed for? Eight hundred thousand francs! And Gomer, the packer opposite to him—another Republican, that one—he smashed the tongs on his wife's head, and he drank so much absinthe that he is going to be put into a private asylum. That's the way with the whole of them—the Republicans! A Republic at twenty-five percent. Ah! yes! plume yourself upon it!""

Frederick took himself off. He was disgusted at the foolishness of this girl, which revealed itself all at once in the language of the populace. He felt himself even becoming a little patriotic once more.

The ill-temper of Rosanette only increased. Mademoiselle Vatnaz irritated him with her enthusiasm. Believing that she had a mission, she felt a furious desire to make speeches, to carry on disputes, and—sharper than Rosanette in matters of this sort—overwhelmed her with arguments.

One day she made her appearance burning with indignation against Hussonnet, who had just indulged in some blackguard remarks at the Woman's Club. Rosanette approved of this conduct, declaring even that she would take men's clothes to go and ""give them a bit of her mind, the entire lot of them, and to whip them.""

Frederick entered at the same moment.

""You'll accompany me—won't you?""

And, in spite of his presence, a bickering match took place between them, one of them playing the part of a citizen's wife and the other of a female philosopher.

According to Rosanette, women were born exclusively for love, or in order to bring up children, to be housekeepers.

According to Mademoiselle Vatnaz, women ought to have a position in the Government. In former times, the Gaulish women, and also the Anglo-Saxon women, took part in the legislation; the squaws of the Hurons formed a portion of the Council. The work of civilisation was common to both. It was necessary that all should contribute towards it, and that fraternity should be substituted for egoism, association for individualism, and cultivation on a large scale for minute subdivision of land.

""Come, that is good! you know a great deal about culture just now!""

""Why not? Besides, it is a question of humanity, of its future!""

""Mind your own business!""

""This is my business!""

They got into a passion. Frederick interposed. The Vatnaz became very heated, and went so far as to uphold Communism.

""What nonsense!"" said Rosanette. ""How could such a thing ever come to pass?""

The other brought forward in support of her theory the examples of the Essenes, the Moravian Brethren, the Jesuits of Paraguay, the family of the Pingons near Thiers in Auvergne; and, as she gesticulated a great deal, her gold chain got entangled in her bundle of trinkets, to which was attached a gold ornament in the form of a sheep.

Suddenly, Rosanette turned exceedingly pale.

Mademoiselle Vatnaz continued extricating her trinkets.

""Don't give yourself so much trouble,"" said Rosanette. ""Now, I know your political opinions.""

""What?"" replied the Vatnaz, with a blush on her face like that of a virgin.

""Oh! oh! you understand me.""

Frederick did not understand. There had evidently been something taking place between them of a more important and intimate character than Socialism.

""And even though it should be so,"" said the Vatnaz in reply, rising up unflinchingly. ""'Tis a loan, my dear—set off one debt against the other.""

""Faith, I don't deny my own debts. I owe some thousands of francs—a nice sum. I borrow, at least; I don't rob anyone.""

Mademoiselle Vatnaz made an effort to laugh.

""Oh! I would put my hand in the fire for him.""

""Take care! it is dry enough to burn.""

The spinster held out her right hand to her, and keeping it raised in front of her:

""But there are friends of yours who find it convenient for them.""

""Andalusians, I suppose? as castanets?""

""You beggar!""

The Maréchale made her a low bow.

""There's nobody so charming!""

Mademoiselle Vatnaz made no reply. Beads of perspiration appeared on her temples. Her eyes fixed themselves on the carpet. She panted for breath. At last she reached the door, and slamming it vigorously: ""Good night! You'll hear from me!""

""Much I care!"" said Rosanette. The effort of self-suppression had shattered her nerves. She sank down on the divan, shaking all over, stammering forth words of abuse, shedding tears. Was it this threat on the part of the Vatnaz that had caused so much agitation in her mind? Oh, no! what did she care, indeed, about that one? It was the golden sheep, a present, and in the midst of her tears the name of Delmar escaped her lips. So, then, she was in love with the mummer?

""In that case, why did she take on with me?"" Frederick asked himself. ""How is it that he has come back again? Who compels her to keep me? Where is the sense of this sort of thing?""

Rosanette was still sobbing. She remained all the time stretched at the edge of the divan, with her right cheek resting on her two hands, and she seemed a being so dainty, so free from self-consciousness, and so sorely troubled, that he drew closer to her and softly kissed her on the forehead.

Thereupon she gave him assurances of her affection for him; the Prince had just left her, they would be free. But she was for the time being short of money. ""You saw yourself that this was so, the other day, when I was trying to turn my old linings to use."" No more equipages now! And this was not all; the upholsterer was threatening to resume possession of the bedroom and the large drawing-room furniture. She did not know what to do.

Frederick had a mind to answer:

""Don't annoy yourself about it. I will pay.""

But the lady knew how to lie. Experience had enlightened her. He confined himself to mere expressions of sympathy.

Rosanette's fears were not vain. It was necessary to give up the furniture and to quit the handsome apartment in the Rue Drouot. She took another on the Boulevard Poissonnière, on the fourth floor.

The curiosities of her old boudoir were quite sufficient to give to the three rooms a coquettish air. There were Chinese blinds, a tent on the terrace, and in the drawing-room a second-hand carpet still perfectly new, with ottomans covered with pink silk. Frederick had contributed largely to these purchases. He had felt the joy of a newly-married man who possesses at last a house of his own, a wife of his own—and, being much pleased with the place, he used to sleep there nearly every evening.

One morning, as he was passing out through the anteroom, he saw, on the third floor, on the staircase, the shako of a National Guard who was ascending it. Where in the world was he going?

Frederick waited. The man continued his progress up the stairs, with his head slightly bent down. He raised his eyes. It was my lord Arnoux!

The situation was clear. They both reddened simultaneously, overcome by a feeling of embarrassment common to both.

Arnoux was the first to find a way out of the difficulty.

""She is better—isn't that so?"" as if Rosanette were ill, and he had come to learn how she was.

Frederick took advantage of this opening.

""Yes, certainly! at least, so I was told by her maid,"" wishing to convey that he had not been allowed to see her.

Then they stood facing each other, both undecided as to what they would do next, and eyeing one another intently. The question now was, which of the two was going to remain. Arnoux once more solved the problem.

""Pshaw! I'll come back by-and-by. Where are you going? I go with you!""

And, when they were in the street, he chatted as naturally as usual. Unquestionably he was not a man of jealous disposition, or else he was too good-natured to get angry. Besides, his time was devoted to serving his country. He never left off his uniform now. On the twenty-ninth of March he had defended the offices of the Presse. When the Chamber was invaded, he distinguished himself by his courage, and he was at the banquet given to the National Guard at Amiens.

Hussonnet, who was still on duty with him, availed himself of his flask and his cigars; but, irreverent by nature, he delighted in contradicting him, disparaging the somewhat inaccurate style of the decrees; and decrying the conferences at the Luxembourg, the women known as the ""Vésuviennes,"" the political section bearing the name of ""Tyroliens""; everything, in fact, down to the Car of Agriculture, drawn by horses to the ox-market, and escorted by ill-favoured young girls. Arnoux, on the other hand, was the upholder of authority, and dreamed of uniting the different parties. However, his own affairs had taken an unfavourable turn, and he was more or less anxious about them.

He was not much troubled about Frederick's relations with the Maréchale; for this discovery made him feel justified (in his conscience) in withdrawing the allowance which he had renewed since the Prince had left her. He pleaded by way of excuse for this step the embarrassed condition in which he found himself, uttered many lamentations—and Rosanette was generous. The result was that M. Arnoux regarded himself as the lover who appealed entirely to the heart, an idea that raised him in his own estimation and made him feel young again. Having no doubt that Frederick was paying the Maréchale, he fancied that he was ""playing a nice trick"" on the young man, even called at the house in such a stealthy fashion as to keep the other in ignorance of the fact, and when they happened to meet, left the coast clear for him.

Frederick was not pleased with this partnership, and his rival's politeness seemed only an elaborate piece of sarcasm. But by taking offence at it, he would have removed from his path every opportunity of ever finding his way back to Madame Arnoux; and then, this was the only means whereby he could hear about her movements. The earthenware-dealer, in accordance with his usual practice, or perhaps with some cunning design, recalled her readily in the course of conversation, and asked him why he no longer came to see her.

Frederick, having exhausted every excuse he could frame, assured him that he had called several times to see Madame Arnoux, but without success. Arnoux was convinced that this was so, for he had often referred in an eager tone at home to the absence of their friend, and she had invariably replied that she was out when he called, so that these two lies, in place of contradicting, corroborated each other.

The young man's gentle ways and the pleasure of finding a dupe in him made Arnoux like him all the better. He carried familiarity to its extreme limits, not through disdain, but through assurance. One day he wrote saying that very urgent business compelled him to be away in the country for twenty-four hours. He begged of the young man to mount guard in his stead. Frederick dared not refuse, so he repaired to the guard-house in the Place du Carrousel.

He had to submit to the society of the National Guards, and, with the exception of a sugar-refiner, a witty fellow who drank to an inordinate extent, they all appeared to him more stupid than their cartridge-boxes. The principal subject of conversation amongst them was the substitution of sashes for belts. Others declaimed against the national workshops.

One man said:

""Where are we going?""

The man to whom the words had been addressed opened his eyes as if he were standing on the verge of an abyss.

""Where are we going?""

Then, one who was more daring than the rest exclaimed:

""It cannot last! It must come to an end!""

And as the same kind of talk went on till night, Frederick was bored to death.

Great was his surprise when, at eleven o'clock, he suddenly beheld Arnoux, who immediately explained that he had hurried back to set him at liberty, having disposed of his own business.

The fact was that he had no business to transact. The whole thing was an invention to enable him to spend twenty-four hours alone with Rosanette. But the worthy Arnoux had placed too much confidence in his own powers, so that, now in the state of lassitude which was the result, he was seized with remorse. He had come to thank Frederick, and to invite him to have some supper.

""A thousand thanks! I'm not hungry. All I want is to go to bed.""

""A reason the more for having a snack together. How flabby you are! One does not go home at such an hour as this. It is too late! It would be dangerous!""

Frederick once more yielded. Arnoux was quite a favorite with his brethren-in-arms, who had not expected to see him—and he was a particular crony of the refiner. They were all fond of him, and he was such a good fellow that he was sorry Hussonnet was not there. But he wanted to shut his eyes for one minute, no longer.

""Sit down beside me!"" said he to Frederick, stretching himself on the camp-bed without taking off his belt and straps. Through fear of an alarm, in spite of the regulation, he even kept his gun in his hand, then stammered out some words:

""My darling! my little angel!"" and ere long was fast asleep.

Those who had been talking to each other became silent; and gradually there was a deep silence in the guard-house. Frederick tormented by the fleas, kept staring about him. The wall, painted yellow, had, half-way up, a long shelf, on which the knapsacks formed a succession of little humps, while underneath, the muskets, which had the colour of lead, rose up side by side; and there could be heard a succession of snores, produced by the National Guards, whose stomachs were outlined through the darkness in a confused fashion. On the top of the stove stood an empty bottle and some plates. Three straw chairs were drawn around the table, on which a pack of cards was displayed. A drum, in the middle of the bench, let its strap hang down.

A warm breath of air making its way through the door caused the lamp to smoke. Arnoux slept with his two arms wide apart; and, as his gun was placed in a slightly crooked position, with the butt-end downward, the mouth of the barrel came up right under his arm. Frederick noticed this, and was alarmed.

""But, no, I'm wrong, there's nothing to be afraid of! And yet, suppose he met his death!""

And immediately pictures unrolled themselves before his mind in endless succession.

He saw himself with her at night in a post-chaise, then on a river's bank on a summer's evening, and under the reflection of a lamp at home in their own house. He even fixed his attention on household expenses and domestic arrangements, contemplating, feeling already his happiness between his hands; and in order to realise it, all that was needed was that the cock of the gun should rise. The end of it could be pushed with one's toe, the gun would go off—it would be a mere accident—nothing more!

Frederick brooded over this idea like a playwright in the agonies of composition. Suddenly it seemed to him that it was not far from being carried into practical operation, and that he was going to contribute to that result—that, in fact, he was yearning for it; and then a feeling of absolute terror took possession of him. In the midst of this mental distress he experienced a sense of pleasure, and he allowed himself to sink deeper and deeper into it, with a dreadful consciousness all the time that his scruples were vanishing. In the wildness of his reverie the rest of the world became effaced, and he could only realise that he was still alive from the intolerable oppression on his chest.

""Let us take a drop of white wine!"" said the refiner, as he awoke.

Arnoux sprang to his feet, and, as soon as the white wine was swallowed, he wanted to relieve Frederick of his sentry duty.

Then he brought him to have breakfast in the Rue de Chartres, at Parly's, and as he required to recuperate his energies, he ordered two dishes of meat, a lobster, an omelet with rum, a salad, etc., and finished this off with a brand of Sauterne of 1819 and one of '42 Romanée, not to speak of the champagne at dessert and the liqueurs.

Frederick did not in any way gainsay him. He was disturbed in mind as if by the thought that the other might somehow trace on his countenance the idea that had lately flitted before his imagination. With both elbows on the table and his head bent forward, so that he annoyed Frederick by his fixed stare, he confided some of his hobbies to the young man.

He wanted to take for farming purposes all the embankments on the Northern line, in order to plant potatoes there, or else to organise on the boulevards a monster cavalcade in which the celebrities of the period would figure. He would let all the windows, which would, at the rate of three francs for each person, produce a handsome profit. In short, he dreamed of a great stroke of fortune by means of a monopoly. He assumed a moral tone, nevertheless, found fault with excesses and all sorts of misconduct, spoke about his ""poor father,"" and every evening, as he said, made an examination of his conscience before offering his soul to God.

""A little curaçao, eh?""

""Just as you please.""

As for the Republic, things would right themselves; in fact, he looked on himself as the happiest man on earth; and forgetting himself, he exalted Rosanette's attractive qualities, and even compared her with his wife. It was quite a different thing. You could not imagine a lovelier person!

""Your health!""

Frederick touched glasses with him. He had, out of complaisance, drunk a little too much. Besides, the strong sunlight dazzled him; and when they went up the Rue Vivienne together again, their shoulders touched each other in a fraternal fashion.

When he got home, Frederick slept till seven o'clock. After that he called on the Maréchale. She had gone out with somebody—with Arnoux, perhaps! Not knowing what to do with himself, he continued his promenade along the boulevard, but could not get past the Porte Saint-Martin, owing to the great crowd that blocked the way.

Want had abandoned to their own resources a considerable number of workmen, and they used to come there every evening, no doubt for the purpose of holding a review and awaiting a signal.

In spite of the law against riotous assemblies, these clubs of despair increased to a frightful extent, and many citizens repaired every day to the spot through bravado, and because it was the fashion.

All of a sudden Frederick caught a glimpse, three paces away, of M. Dambreuse along with Martinon. He turned his head away, for M. Dambreuse having got himself nominated as a representative of the people, he cherished a secret spite against him. But the capitalist stopped him.

""One word, my dear monsieur! I have some explanations to make to you.""

""I am not asking you for any.""

""Pray listen to me!""

It was not his fault in any way. Appeals had been made to him; pressure had, to a certain extent, been placed on him. Martinon immediately endorsed all that he had said. Some of the electors of Nogent had presented themselves in a deputation at his house.

""Besides, I expected to be free as soon as——""

A crush of people on the footpath forced M. Dambreuse to get out of the way. A minute after he reappeared, saying to Martinon:

""This is a genuine service, really, and you won't have any reason to regret——""

All three stood with their backs resting against a shop in order to be able to chat more at their ease.

From time to time there was a cry of, ""Long live Napoléon! Long live Barbès! Down with Marie!""

The countless throng kept talking in very loud tones; and all these voices, echoing through the houses, made, so to speak, the continuous ripple of waves in a harbour. At intervals they ceased; and then could be heard voices singing the ""Marseillaise.""

Under the court-gates, men of mysterious aspect offered sword-sticks to those who passed. Sometimes two individuals, one of whom preceded the other, would wink, and then quickly hurry away. The footpaths were filled with groups of staring idlers. A dense crowd swayed to and fro on the pavement. Entire bands of police-officers, emerging from the alleys, had scarcely made their way into the midst of the multitude when they were swallowed up in the mass of people. Little red flags here and there looked like flames. Coachmen, from the place where they sat high up, gesticulated energetically, and then turned to go back. It was a case of perpetual movement—one of the strangest sights that could be conceived.

""How all this,"" said Martinon, ""would have amused Mademoiselle Cécile!""

""My wife, as you are aware, does not like my niece to come with us,"" returned M. Dambreuse with a smile.

One could scarcely recognise in him the same man. For the past three months he had been crying, ""Long live the Republic!"" and he had even voted in favour of the banishment of Orléans. But there should be an end of concessions. He exhibited his rage so far as to carry a tomahawk in his pocket.

Martinon had one, too. The magistracy not being any longer irremovable, he had withdrawn from Parquet, so that he surpassed M. Dambreuse in his display of violence.

The banker had a special antipathy to Lamartine (for having supported Ledru-Rollin) and, at the same time, to Pierre Leroux, Proudhon, Considérant, Lamennais, and all the cranks, all the Socialists.

""For, in fact, what is it they want? The duty on meat and arrest for debt have been abolished. Now the project of a bank for mortgages is under consideration; the other day it was a national bank; and here are five millions in the Budget for the working-men! But luckily, it is over, thanks to Monsieur de Falloux! Good-bye to them! let them go!""

In fact, not knowing how to maintain the three hundred thousand men in the national workshops, the Minister of Public Works had that very day signed an order inviting all citizens between the ages of eighteen and twenty to take service as soldiers, or else to start for the provinces to cultivate the ground there.

They were indignant at the alternative thus put before them, convinced that the object was to destroy the Republic. They were aggrieved by the thought of having to live at a distance from the capital, as if it were a kind of exile. They saw themselves dying of fevers in desolate parts of the country. To many of them, moreover, who had been accustomed to work of a refined description, agriculture seemed a degradation; it was, in short, a mockery, a decisive breach of all the promises which had been made to them. If they offered any resistance, force would be employed against them. They had no doubt of it, and made preparations to anticipate it.

About nine o'clock the riotous assemblies which had formed at the Bastille and at the Châtelet ebbed back towards the boulevard. From the Porte Saint-Denis to the Porte Saint-Martin nothing could be seen save an enormous swarm of people, a single mass of a dark blue shade, nearly black. The men of whom one caught a glimpse all had glowing eyes, pale complexions, faces emaciated with hunger and excited with a sense of wrong.

Meanwhile, some clouds had gathered. The tempestuous sky roused the electricity that was in the people, and they kept whirling about of their own accord with the great swaying movements of a swelling sea, and one felt that there was an incalculable force in the depths of this excited throng, and as it were, the energy of an element. Then they all began exclaiming: ""Lamps! lamps!"" Many windows had no illumination, and stones were flung at the panes. M. Dambreuse deemed it prudent to withdraw from the scene. The two young men accompanied him home. He predicted great disasters. The people might once more invade the Chamber, and on this point he told them how he should have been killed on the fifteenth of May had it not been for the devotion of a National Guard.

""But I had forgotten! he is a friend of yours—your friend the earthenware manufacturer—Jacques Arnoux!"" The rioters had been actually throttling him, when that brave citizen caught him in his arms and put him safely out of their reach.

So it was that, since then, there had been a kind of intimacy between them.

""It would be necessary, one of these days, to dine together, and, since you often see him, give him the assurance that I like him very much. He is an excellent man, and has, in my opinion, been slandered; and he has his wits about him in the morning. My compliments once more! A very good evening!""

Frederick, after he had quitted M. Dambreuse, went back to the Maréchale, and, in a very gloomy fashion, said that she should choose between him and Arnoux. She replied that she did not understand ""dumps of this sort,"" that she did not care about Arnoux, and had no desire to cling to him. Frederick was thirsting to fly from Paris. She did not offer any opposition to this whim; and next morning they set out for Fontainebleau.

The hotel at which they stayed could be distinguished from others by a fountain that rippled in the middle of the courtyard attached to it. The doors of the various apartments opened out on a corridor, as in monasteries. The room assigned to them was large, well-furnished, hung with print, and noiseless, owing to the scarcity of tourists. Alongside the houses, people who had nothing to do kept passing up and down; then, under their windows, when the day was declining, children in the street would engage in a game of base; and this tranquillity, following so soon the tumult they had witnessed in Paris, filled them with astonishment and exercised over them a soothing influence.

Every morning at an early hour, they went to pay a visit to the château. As they passed in through the gate, they had a view of its entire front, with the five pavilions covered with sharp-pointed roofs, and its staircase of horseshoe-shape opening out to the end of the courtyard, which is hemmed in, to right and left, by two main portions of the building further down. On the paved ground lichens blended their colours here and there with the tawny hue of bricks, and the entire appearance of the palace, rust-coloured like old armour, had about it something of the impassiveness of royalty—a sort of warlike, melancholy grandeur.

At last, a man-servant made his appearance with a bunch of keys in his hand. He first showed them the apartments of the queens, the Pope's oratory, the gallery of Francis I., the mahogany table on which the Emperor signed his abdication, and in one of the rooms cut in two the old Galerie des Cerfs, the place where Christine got Monaldeschi assassinated. Rosanette listened to this narrative attentively, then, turning towards Frederick:

""No doubt it was through jealousy? Mind yourself!"" After this they passed through the Council Chamber, the Guards' Room, the Throne Room, and the drawing-room of Louis XIII. The uncurtained windows sent forth a white light. The handles of the window-fastenings and the copper feet of the pier-tables were slightly tarnished with dust. The armchairs were everywhere hidden under coarse linen covers. Above the doors could be seen reliquaries of Louis XIV., and here and there hangings representing the gods of Olympus, Psyche, or the battles of Alexander.

As she was passing in front of the mirrors, Rosanette stopped for a moment to smooth her head-bands.

After passing through the donjon-court and the Saint-Saturnin Chapel, they reached the Festal Hall.

They were dazzled by the magnificence of the ceiling, which was divided into octagonal apartments set off with gold and silver, more finely chiselled than a jewel, and by the vast number of paintings covering the walls, from the immense chimney-piece, where the arms of France were surrounded by crescents and quivers, down to the musicians' gallery, which had been erected at the other end along the entire width of the hall. The ten arched windows were wide open; the sun threw its lustre on the pictures, so that they glowed beneath its rays; the blue sky continued in an endless curve the ultramarine of the arches; and from the depths of the woods, where the lofty summits of the trees filled up the horizon, there seemed to come an echo of flourishes blown by ivory trumpets, and mythological ballets, gathering together under the foliage princesses and nobles disguised as nymphs or fauns—an epoch of ingenuous science, of violent passions, and sumptuous art, when the ideal was to sweep away the world in a vision of the Hesperides, and when the mistresses of kings mingled their glory with the stars. There was a portrait of one of the most beautiful of these celebrated women in the form of Diana the huntress, and even the Infernal Diana, no doubt in order to indicate the power which she possessed even beyond the limits of the tomb. All these symbols confirmed her glory, and there remained about the spot something of her, an indistinct voice, a radiation that stretched out indefinitely. A feeling of mysterious retrospective voluptuousness took possession of Frederick.

In order to divert these passionate longings into another channel, he began to gaze tenderly on Rosanette, and asked her would she not like to have been this woman?

""What woman?""

""Diane de Poitiers!""

He repeated:

""Diane de Poitiers, the mistress of Henry II.""

She gave utterance to a little ""Ah!"" that was all.

Her silence clearly demonstrated that she knew nothing about the matter, and had failed to comprehend his meaning, so that out of complaisance he said to her:

""Perhaps you are getting tired of this?""

""No, no—quite the reverse."" And lifting up her chin, and casting around her a glance of the vaguest description, Rosanette let these words escape her lips:

""It recalls some memories to me!""

Meanwhile, it was easy to trace on her countenance a strained expression, a certain sense of awe; and, as this air of gravity made her look all the prettier, Frederick overlooked it.

The carps' pond amused her more. For a quarter of an hour she kept flinging pieces of bread into the water in order to see the fishes skipping about.

Frederick had seated himself by her side under the linden-trees. He saw in imagination all the personages who had haunted these walls—Charles V., the Valois Kings, Henry IV., Peter the Great, Jean Jacques Rousseau, and ""the fair mourners of the stage-boxes,"" Voltaire, Napoléon, Pius VII., and Louis Philippe; and he felt himself environed, elbowed, by these tumultuous dead people. He was stunned by such a confusion of historic figures, even though he found a certain fascination in contemplating them, nevertheless.

At length they descended into the flower-garden.

It is a vast rectangle, which presents to the spectator, at the first glance, its wide yellow walks, its square grass-plots, its ribbons of box-wood, its yew-trees shaped like pyramids, its low-lying green swards, and its narrow borders, in which thinly-sown flowers make spots on the grey soil. At the end of the garden may be seen a park through whose entire length a canal makes its way.

Royal residences have attached to them a peculiar kind of melancholy, due, no doubt, to their dimensions being much too large for the limited number of guests entertained within them, to the silence which one feels astonished to find in them after so many flourishes of trumpets, to the immobility of their luxurious furniture, which attests by the aspect of age and decay it gradually assumes the transitory character of dynasties, the eternal wretchedness of all things; and this exhalation of the centuries, enervating and funereal, like the perfume of a mummy, makes itself felt even in untutored brains. Rosanette yawned immoderately. They went back to the hotel.

After their breakfast an open carriage came round for them. They started from Fontainebleau at a point where several roads diverged, then went up at a walking pace a gravelly road leading towards a little pine-wood. The trees became larger, and, from time to time, the driver would say, ""This is the Frères Siamois, the Pharamond, the Bouquet de Roi,"" not forgetting a single one of these notable sites, sometimes even drawing up to enable them to admire the scene.

They entered the forest of Franchard. The carriage glided over the grass like a sledge; pigeons which they could not see began cooing. Suddenly, the waiter of a café made his appearance, and they alighted before the railing of a garden in which a number of round tables were placed. Then, passing on the left by the walls of a ruined abbey, they made their way over big boulders of stone, and soon reached the lower part of the gorge.

It is covered on one side with sandstones and juniper-trees tangled together, while on the other side the ground, almost quite bare, slopes towards the hollow of the valley, where a foot-track makes a pale line through the brown heather; and far above could be traced a flat cone-shaped summit with a telegraph-tower behind it.

Half-an-hour later they stepped out of the vehicle once more, in order to climb the heights of Aspremont.

The roads form zigzags between the thick-set pine-trees under rocks with angular faces. All this corner of the forest has a sort of choked-up look—a rather wild and solitary aspect. One thinks of hermits in connection with it—companions of huge stags with fiery crosses between their horns, who were wont to welcome with paternal smiles the good kings of France when they knelt before their grottoes. The warm air was filled with a resinous odour, and roots of trees crossed one another like veins close to the soil. Rosanette slipped over them, grew dejected, and felt inclined to shed tears.

But, at the very top, she became joyous once more on finding, under a roof made of branches, a sort of tavern where carved wood was sold. She drank a bottle of lemonade, and bought a holly-stick; and, without one glance towards the landscape which disclosed itself from the plateau, she entered the Brigands' Cave, with a waiter carrying a torch in front of her. Their carriage was awaiting them in the Bas Breau.

A painter in a blue blouse was working at the foot of an oak-tree with his box of colours on his knees. He raised his head and watched them as they passed.

In the middle of the hill of Chailly, the sudden breaking of a cloud caused them to turn up the hoods of their cloaks. Almost immediately the rain stopped, and the paving-stones of the street glistened under the sun when they were re-entering the town.

Some travellers, who had recently arrived, informed them that a terrible battle had stained Paris with blood. Rosanette and her lover were not surprised. Then everybody left; the hotel became quiet, the gas was put out, and they were lulled to sleep by the murmur of the fountain in the courtyard.

On the following day they went to see the Wolf's Gorge, the Fairies' Pool, the Long Rock, and the Marlotte.[G] Two days later, they began again at random, just as their coachman thought fit to drive them, without asking where they were, and often even neglecting the famous sites.

They felt so comfortable in their old landau, low as a sofa, and covered with a rug made of a striped material which was quite faded. The moats, filled with brushwood, stretched out under their eyes with a gentle, continuous movement. White rays passed like arrows through the tall ferns. Sometimes a road that was no longer used presented itself before them, in a straight line, and here and there might be seen a feeble growth of weeds. In the centre between four cross-roads, a crucifix extended its four arms. In other places, stakes were bending down like dead trees, and little curved paths, which were lost under the leaves, made them feel a longing to pursue them. At the same moment the horse turned round; they  entered there; they plunged into the mire. Further down moss had sprouted out at the sides of the deep ruts.

They believed that they were far away from all other people, quite alone. But suddenly a game-keeper with his gun, or a band of women in rags with big bundles of fagots on their backs, would hurry past them.

When the carriage stopped, there was a universal silence. The only sounds that reached them were the blowing of the horse in the shafts with the faint cry of a bird more than once repeated.

The light at certain points illuminating the outskirts of the wood, left the interior in deep shadow, or else, attenuated in the foreground by a sort of twilight, it exhibited in the background violet vapours, a white radiance. The midday sun, falling directly on wide tracts of greenery, made splashes of light over them, hung gleaming drops of silver from the ends of the branches, streaked the grass with long lines of emeralds, and flung gold spots on the beds of dead leaves. When they let their heads fall back, they could distinguish the sky through the tops of the trees. Some of them, which were enormously high, looked like patriarchs or emperors, or, touching one another at their extremities formed with their long shafts, as it were, triumphal arches; others, sprouting forth obliquely from below, seemed like falling columns. This heap of big vertical lines gaped open. Then, enormous green billows unrolled themselves in unequal embossments as far as the surface of the valleys, towards which advanced the brows of other hills looking down on white plains, which ended by losing themselves in an undefined pale tinge.

Standing side by side, on some rising ground, they felt, as they drank in the air, the pride of a life more free penetrating into the depths of their souls, with a superabundance of energy, a joy which they could not explain.

The variety of trees furnished a spectacle of the most diversified character. The beeches with their smooth white bark twisted their tops together. Ash trees softly curved their bluish branches. In the tufts of the hornbeams rose up holly stiff as bronze. Then came a row of thin birches, bent into elegiac attitudes; and the pine-trees, symmetrical as organ pipes, seemed to be singing a song as they swayed to and fro. There were gigantic oaks with knotted forms, which had been violently shaken, stretched themselves out from the soil and pressed close against each other, and with firm trunks resembling torsos, launched forth to heaven despairing appeals with their bare arms and furious threats, like a group of Titans struck motionless in the midst of their rage. An atmosphere of gloom, a feverish languor, brooded over the pools, whose sheets of water were cut into flakes by the overshadowing thorn-trees. The lichens on their banks, where the wolves come to drink, are of the colour of sulphur, burnt, as it were, by the footprints of witches, and the incessant croaking of the frogs responds to the cawing of the crows as they wheel through the air. After this they passed through the monotonous glades, planted here and there with a staddle. The sound of iron falling with a succession of rapid blows could be heard. On the side of the hill a group of quarrymen were breaking the rocks. These rocks became more and more numerous and finally filled up the entire landscape, cube-shaped like houses, flat like flagstones, propping up, overhanging, and became intermingled with each other, as if they were the ruins, unrecognisable and monstrous, of some vanished city. But the wild chaos they exhibited made one rather dream of volcanoes, of deluges, of great unknown cataclysms. Frederick said they had been there since the beginning of the world, and would remain so till the end. Rosanette turned aside her head, declaring that this would drive her out of her mind, and went off to collect sweet heather. The little violet blossoms, heaped up near one another, formed unequal plates, and the soil, which was giving way underneath, placed soft dark fringes on the sand spangled with mica.

One day they reached a point half-way up a hill, where the soil was full of sand. Its surface, untrodden till now, was streaked so as to resemble symmetrical waves. Here and there, like promontories on the dry bed of an ocean, rose up rocks with the vague outlines of animals, tortoises thrusting forward their heads, crawling seals, hippopotami, and bears. Not a soul around them. Not a single sound. The shingle glowed under the dazzling rays of the sun, and all at once in this vibration of light the specimens of the brute creation that met their gaze began to move about. They returned home quickly, flying from the dizziness that had seized hold of them, almost dismayed.

The gravity of the forest exercised an influence over them, and hours passed in silence, during which, allowing themselves to yield to the lulling effects of springs, they remained as it were sunk in the torpor of a calm intoxication. With his arm around her waist, he listened to her talking while the birds were warbling, noticed with the same glance the black grapes on her bonnet and the juniper-berries, the draperies of her veil, and the spiral forms assumed by the clouds, and when he bent towards her the freshness of her skin mingled with the strong perfume of the woods. They found amusement in everything. They showed one another, as a curiosity, gossamer threads of the Virgin hanging from bushes, holes full of water in the middle of stones, a squirrel on the branches, the way in which two butterflies kept flying after them; or else, at twenty paces from them, under the trees, a hind strode on peacefully, with an air of nobility and gentleness, its doe walking by its side.

Rosanette would have liked to run after it to embrace it.

She got very much alarmed once, when a man suddenly presenting himself, showed her three vipers in a box. She wildly flung herself on Frederick's breast. He felt happy at the thought that she was weak and that he was strong enough to defend her.

That evening they dined at an inn on the banks of the Seine. The table was near the window, Rosanette sitting opposite him, and he contemplated her little well-shaped white nose, her turned-up lips, her bright eyes, the swelling bands of her nut-brown hair, and her pretty oval face. Her dress of raw silk clung to her somewhat drooping shoulders, and her two hands, emerging from their sleeves, joined close together as if they were one—carved, poured out wine, moved over the table-cloth. The waiters placed before them a chicken with its four limbs stretched out, a stew of eels in a dish of pipe-clay, wine that had got spoiled, bread that was too hard, and knives with notches in them. All these things made the repast more enjoyable and strengthened the illusion. They fancied that they were in the middle of a journey in Italy on their honeymoon. Before starting again they went for a walk along the bank of the river.

The soft blue sky, rounded like a dome, leaned at the horizon on the indentations of the woods. On the opposite side, at the end of the meadow, there was a village steeple; and further away, to the left, the roof of a house made a red spot on the river, which wound its way without any apparent motion. Some rushes bent over it, however, and the water lightly shook some poles fixed at its edge in order to hold nets. An osier bow-net and two or three old fishing-boats might be seen there. Near the inn a girl in a straw hat was drawing buckets out of a well. Every time they came up again, Frederick heard the grating sound of the chain with a feeling of inexpressible delight.

He had no doubt that he would be happy till the end of his days, so natural did his felicity appear to him, so much a part of his life, and so intimately associated with this woman's being. He was irresistibly impelled to address her with words of endearment. She answered with pretty little speeches, light taps on the shoulder, displays of tenderness that charmed him by their unexpectedness. He discovered in her quite a new sort of beauty, in fact, which was perhaps only the reflection of surrounding things, unless it happened to bud forth from their hidden potentialities.

When they were lying down in the middle of the field, he would stretch himself out with his head on her lap, under the shelter of her parasol; or else with their faces turned towards the green sward, in the centre of which they rested, they kept gazing towards one another so that their pupils seemed to intermingle, thirsting for one another and ever satiating their thirst, and then with half-closed eyelids they lay side by side without uttering a single word.

Now and then the distant rolling of a drum reached their ears. It was the signal-drum which was being beaten in the different villages calling on people to go and defend Paris.

""Oh! look here! 'tis the rising!"" said Frederick, with a disdainful pity, all this excitement now presenting to his mind a pitiful aspect by the side of their love and of eternal nature.

And they talked about whatever happened to come into their heads, things that were perfectly familiar to them, persons in whom they took no interest, a thousand trifles. She chatted with him about her chambermaid and her hairdresser. One day she was so self-forgetful that she told him her age—twenty-nine years. She was becoming quite an old woman.

Several times, without intending it, she gave him some particulars with reference to her own life. She had been a ""shop girl,"" had taken a trip to England, and had begun studying for the stage; all this she told without any explanation of how these changes had come about; and he found it impossible to reconstruct her entire history.

She related to him more about herself one day when they were seated side by side under a plane-tree at the back of a meadow. At the road-side, further down, a little barefooted girl, standing amid a heap of dust, was making a cow go to pasture. As soon as she caught sight of them she came up to beg, and while with one hand she held up her tattered petticoat, she kept scratching with the other her black hair, which, like a wig of Louis XIV.'s time, curled round her dark face, lighted by a magnificent pair of eyes.

""She will be very pretty by-and-by,"" said Frederick.

""How lucky she is, if she has no mother!"" remarked Rosanette.

""Eh? How is that?""

""Certainly. I, if it were not for mine——""

She sighed, and began to speak about her childhood. Her parents were weavers in the Croix-Rousse. She acted as an apprentice to her father. In vain did the poor man wear himself out with hard work; his wife was continually abusing him, and sold everything for drink. Rosanette could see, as if it were yesterday, the room they occupied with the looms ranged lengthwise against the windows, the pot boiling on the stove, the bed painted like mahogany, a cupboard facing it, and the obscure loft where she used to sleep up to the time when she was fifteen years old. At length a gentleman made his appearance on the scene—a fat man with a face of the colour of boxwood, the manners of a devotee, and a suit of black clothes. Her mother and this man had a conversation together, with the result that three days afterwards—Rosanette stopped, and with a look in which there was as much bitterness as shamelessness:

""It was done!""

Then, in response to a gesture of Frederick.

""As he was married (he would have been afraid of compromising himself in his own house), I was brought to a private room in a restaurant, and told that I would be happy, that I would get a handsome present.

""At the door, the first thing that struck me was a candelabrum of vermilion on a table, on which there were two covers. A mirror on the ceiling showed their reflections, and the blue silk hangings on the walls made the entire apartment resemble an alcove; I was seized with astonishment. You understand—a poor creature who had never seen anything before. In spite of my dazed condition of mind, I got frightened. I wanted to go away. However, I remained.

""The only seat in the room was a sofa close beside the table. It was so soft that it gave way under me. The mouth of the hot-air stove in the middle of the carpet sent out towards me a warm breath, and there I sat without taking anything. The waiter, who was standing near me, urged me to eat. He poured out for me immediately a large glass of wine. My head began to swim, I wanted to open the window. He said to me:

""'No, Mademoiselle! that is forbidden.'""

""And he left me.

""The table was covered with a heap of things that I had no knowledge of. Nothing there seemed to me good. Then I fell back on a pot of jam, and patiently waited. I did not know what prevented him from coming. It was very late—midnight at last—I couldn't bear the fatigue any longer. While pushing aside one of the pillows, in order to hear better, I found under my hand a kind of album—a  book of engravings, they were vulgar pictures. I was sleeping on top of it when he entered the room.""

She hung down her head and remained pensive.

The leaves rustled around them. Amid the tangled grass a great foxglove was swaying to and fro. The sunlight flowed like a wave over the green expanse, and the silence was interrupted at intervals by the browsing of the cow, which they could no longer see.

Rosanette kept her eyes fixed on a particular spot, three paces away from her, her nostrils heaving, and her mind absorbed in thought. Frederick caught hold of her hand.

""How you suffered, poor darling!""

""Yes,"" said she, ""more than you imagine! So much so that I wanted to make an end of it—they had to fish me up!""

""What?""

""Ah! think no more about it! I love you, I am happy! kiss me!""

And she picked off, one by one, the sprigs of the thistles which clung to the hem of her gown.

Frederick was thinking more than all on what she had not told him. What were the means by which she had gradually emerged from wretchedness? To what lover did she owe her education? What had occurred in her life down to the day when he first came to her house? Her latest avowal was a bar to these questions. All he asked her was how she had made Arnoux's acquaintance.

""Through the Vatnaz.""

""Wasn't it you that I once saw with both of them at the Palais-Royal?""

He referred to the exact date. Rosanette made a movement which showed a sense of deep pain.

""Yes, it is true! I was not gay at that time!""

But Arnoux had proved himself a very good fellow. Frederick had no doubt of it. However, their friend was a queer character, full of faults. He took care to recall them. She quite agreed with him on this point.

""Never mind! One likes him, all the same, this camel!""

""Still—even now?"" said Frederick.

She began to redden, half smiling, half angry.

""Oh, no! that's an old story. I don't keep anything hidden from you. Even though it might be so, with him it is different. Besides, I don't think you are nice towards your victim!""

""My victim!""

Rosanette caught hold of his chin.

""No doubt!""

And in the lisping fashion in which nurses talk to babies:

""Have always been so good! Never went a-by-by with his wife?""

""I! never at any time!""

Rosanette smiled. He felt hurt by this smile of hers, which seemed to him a proof of indifference.

But she went on gently, and with one of those looks which seem to appeal for a denial of the truth:

""Are you perfectly certain?""

""Not a doubt of it!""

Frederick solemnly declared on his word of honour that he had never bestowed a thought on Madame Arnoux, as he was too much in love with another woman.

""Why, with you, my beautiful one!""

""Ah! don't laugh at me! You only annoy me!""

He thought it a prudent course to invent a story—to pretend that he was swayed by a passion. He manufactured some circumstantial details. This woman, however, had rendered him very unhappy.

""Decidedly, you have not been lucky,"" said Rosanette.

""Oh! oh! I may have been!"" wishing to convey in this way that he had been often fortunate in his love-affairs, so that she might have a better opinion of him, just as Rosanette did not avow how many lovers she had had, in order that he might have more respect for her—for there will always be found in the midst of the most intimate confidences restrictions, false shame, delicacy, and pity. You divine either in the other or in yourself precipices or miry paths which prevent you from penetrating any farther; moreover, you feel that you will not be understood. It is hard to express accurately the thing you mean, whatever it may be; and this is the reason why perfect unions are rare.

The poor Maréchale had never known one better than this. Often, when she gazed at Frederick, tears came into her eyes; then she would raise them or cast a glance towards the horizon, as if she saw there some bright dawn, perspectives of boundless felicity. At last, she confessed one day to him that she wished to have a mass said, ""so that it might bring a blessing on our love.""

How was it, then, that she had resisted him so long? She could not tell herself. He repeated his question a great many times; and she replied, as she clasped him in her arms:

""It was because I was afraid, my darling, of loving you too well!""

On Sunday morning, Frederick read, amongst the list of the wounded given in a newspaper, the name of Dussardier. He uttered a cry, and showing the paper to Rosanette, declared that he was going to start at once for Paris.

""For what purpose?""

""In order to see him, to nurse him!""

""You are not going, I'm sure, to leave me by myself?""

""Come with me!""

""Ha! to poke my nose in a squabble of that sort? Oh, no, thanks!""

""However, I cannot——""

""Ta! ta! ta! as if they had need of nurses in the hospitals! And then, what concern is he of yours any longer? Everyone for himself!""

He was roused to indignation by this egoism on her part, and he reproached himself for not being in the capital with the others. Such indifference to the misfortunes of the nation had in it something shabby, and only worthy of a small shopkeeper. And now, all of a sudden, his intrigue with Rosanette weighed on his mind as if it were a crime. For an hour they were quite cool towards each other.

Then she appealed to him to wait, and not expose himself to danger.

""Suppose you happen to be killed?""

""Well, I should only have done my duty!""

Rosanette gave a jump. His first duty was to love her; but, no doubt, he did not care about her any longer. There was no common sense in what he was going to do. Good heavens! what an idea!

Frederick rang for his bill. But to get back to Pans was not an easy matter. The Leloir stagecoach had just left; the Lecomte berlins would not be starting; the diligence from Bourbonnais would not be passing till a late hour that night, and perhaps it might be full, one could never tell. When he had lost a great deal of time in making enquiries about the various modes of conveyance, the idea occurred to him to travel post. The master of the post-house refused to supply him with horses, as Frederick had no passport. Finally, he hired an open carriage—the same one in which they had driven about the country—and at about five o'clock they arrived in front of the Hôtel du Commerce at Melun.

The market-place was covered with piles of arms. The prefect had forbidden the National Guards to proceed towards Paris. Those who did not belong to his department wished to go on. There was a great deal of shouting, and the inn was packed with a noisy crowd.

Rosanette, seized with terror, said she would not go a step further, and once more begged of him to stay. The innkeeper and his wife joined in her entreaties. A decent sort of man who happened to be dining there interposed, and observed that the fighting would be over in a very short time. Besides, one ought to do his duty. Thereupon the Maréchale redoubled her sobs. Frederick got exasperated. He handed her his purse, kissed her quickly, and disappeared.

On reaching Corbeil, he learned at the station that the insurgents had cut the rails at regular distances, and the coachman refused to drive him any farther; he said that his horses were ""overspent.""

Through his influence, however, Frederick managed to procure an indifferent cabriolet, which, for the sum of sixty francs, without taking into account the price of a drink for the driver, was to convey him as far as the Italian barrier. But at a hundred paces from the barrier his coachman made him descend and turn back. Frederick was walking along the pathway, when suddenly a sentinel thrust out his bayonet. Four men seized him, exclaiming:

""This is one of them! Look out! Search him! Brigand! scoundrel!""

And he was so thoroughly stupefied that he let himself be dragged to the guard-house of the barrier, at the very point where the Boulevards des Gobelins and de l'Hôpital and Rues Godefroy and Mauffetard converge.

Four barricades formed at the ends of four different ways enormous sloping ramparts of paving-stones. Torches were glimmering here and there. In spite of the rising clouds of dust he could distinguish foot-soldiers of the Line and National Guards, all with their faces blackened, their chests uncovered, and an aspect of wild excitement. They had just captured the square, and had shot down a number of men. Their rage had not yet cooled. Frederick said he had come from Fontainebleau to the relief of a wounded comrade who lodged in the Rue Bellefond. Not one of them would believe him at first. They examined his hands; they even put their noses to his ear to make sure that he did not smell of powder.

However, by dint of repeating the same thing, he finally satisfied a captain, who directed two fusiliers to conduct him to the guard-house of the Jardin des Plantes. They descended the Boulevard de l'Hôpital. A strong breeze was blowing. It restored him to animation.

After this they turned up the Rue du Marché aux Chevaux. The Jardin des Plantes at the right formed a long black mass, whilst at the left the entire front of the Pitié, illuminated at every window, blazed like a conflagration, and shadows passed rapidly over the window-panes.

The two men in charge of Frederick went away. Another accompanied him to the Polytechnic School. The Rue Saint-Victor was quite dark, without a gas-lamp or a light at any window to relieve the gloom. Every ten minutes could be heard the words:

""Sentinels! mind yourselves!""

And this exclamation, cast into the midst of the silence, was prolonged like the repeated striking of a stone against the side of a chasm as it falls through space.

Every now and then the stamp of heavy footsteps could be heard drawing nearer. This was nothing less than a patrol consisting of about a hundred men. From this confused mass escaped whisperings and the dull clanking of iron; and, moving away with a rhythmic swing, it melted into the darkness.

In the middle of the crossing, where several streets met, a dragoon sat motionless on his horse. From time to time an express rider passed at a rapid gallop; then the silence was renewed. Cannons, which were being drawn along the streets, made, on the pavement, a heavy rolling sound that seemed full of menace—a sound different from every ordinary sound—which oppressed the heart. The sounds was profound, unlimited—a black silence. Men in white blouses accosted the soldiers, spoke one or two words to them, and then vanished like phantoms.

The guard-house of the Polytechnic School overflowed with people. The threshold was blocked up with women, who had come to see their sons or their husbands. They were sent on to the Panthéon, which had been transformed into a dead-house; and no attention was paid to Frederick. He pressed forward resolutely, solemnly declaring that his friend Dussardier was waiting for him, that he was at death's door. At last they sent a corporal to accompany him to the top of the Rue Saint-Jacques, to the Mayor's office in the twelfth arrondissement.

The Place du Panthéon was filled with soldiers lying asleep on straw. The day was breaking; the bivouac-fires were extinguished.

The insurrection had left terrible traces in this quarter. The soil of the streets, from one end to the other, was covered with risings of various sizes. On the wrecked barricades had been piled up omnibuses, gas-pipes, and cart-wheels. In certain places there were little dark pools, which must have been blood. The houses were riddled with projectiles, and their framework could be seen under the plaster that was peeled off. Window-blinds, each attached only by a single nail, hung like rags. The staircases having fallen in, doors opened on vacancy. The interiors of rooms could be perceived with their papers in strips. In some instances dainty objects had remained in them quite intact. Frederick noticed a timepiece, a parrot-stick, and some engravings.

When he entered the Mayor's office, the National Guards were chattering without a moment's pause about the deaths of Bréa and Négrier, about the deputy Charbonnel, and about the Archbishop of Paris. He heard them saying that the Duc d'Aumale had landed at Boulogne, that Barbès had fled from Vincennes, that the artillery were coming up from Bourges, and that abundant aid was arriving from the provinces. About three o'clock some one brought good news.

Truce-bearers from the insurgents were in conference with the President of the Assembly.

Thereupon they all made merry; and as he had a dozen francs left, Frederick sent for a dozen bottles of wine, hoping by this means to hasten his deliverance. Suddenly a discharge of musketry was heard. The drinking stopped. They peered with distrustful eyes into the unknown—it might be Henry V.

In order to get rid of responsibility, they took Frederick to the Mayor's office in the eleventh arrondissement, which he was not permitted to leave till nine o'clock in the morning.

He started at a running pace from the Quai Voltaire. At an open window an old man in his shirt-sleeves was crying, with his eyes raised. The Seine glided peacefully along. The sky was of a clear blue; and in the trees round the Tuileries birds were singing.

Frederick was just crossing the Place du Carrousel when a litter happened to be passing by. The soldiers at the guard-house immediately presented arms; and the officer, putting his hand to his shako, said: ""Honour to unfortunate bravery!"" This phrase seemed to have almost become a matter of duty. He who pronounced it appeared to be, on each occasion, filled with profound emotion. A group of people in a state of fierce excitement followed the litter, exclaiming:

""We will avenge you! we will avenge you!""

The vehicles kept moving about on the boulevard, and women were making lint before the doors. Meanwhile, the outbreak had been quelled, or very nearly so. A proclamation from Cavaignac, just posted up, announced the fact. At the top of the Rue Vivienne, a company of the Garde Mobile appeared. Then the citizens uttered cries of enthusiasm. They raised their hats, applauded, danced, wished to embrace them, and to invite them to drink; and flowers, flung by ladies, fell from the balconies.

At last, at ten o'clock, at the moment when the cannon was booming as an attack was being made on the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, Frederick reached the abode of Dussardier. He found the bookkeeper in his garret, lying asleep on his back. From the adjoining apartment a woman came forth with silent tread—Mademoiselle Vatnaz.

She led Frederick aside and explained to him how Dussardier had got wounded.

On Saturday, on the top of a barricade in the Rue Lafayette, a young fellow wrapped in a tricoloured flag cried out to the National Guards: ""Are you going to shoot your brothers?"" As they advanced, Dussardier threw down his gun, pushed away the others, sprang over the barricade, and, with a blow of an old shoe, knocked down the insurgent, from whom he tore the flag. He had afterwards been found under a heap of rubbish with a slug of copper in his thigh. It was found necessary to make an incision in order to extract the projectile. Mademoiselle Vatnaz arrived the same evening, and since then had not quitted his side.

She intelligently prepared everything that was needed for the dressings, assisted him in taking his medicine or other liquids, attended to his slightest wishes, left and returned again with footsteps more light than those of a fly, and gazed at him with eyes full of tenderness.

Frederick, during the two following weeks, did not fail to come back every morning. One day, while he was speaking about the devotion of the Vatnaz, Dussardier shrugged his shoulders:

""Oh! no! she does this through interested motives.""

""Do you think so?""

He replied: ""I am sure of it!"" without seeming disposed to give any further explanation.

She had loaded him with kindnesses, carrying her attentions so far as to bring him the newspapers in which his gallant action was extolled. He even confessed to Frederick that he felt uneasy in his conscience.

Perhaps he ought to have put himself on the other side with the men in blouses; for, indeed, a heap of promises had been made to them which had not been carried out. Those who had vanquished them hated the Republic; and, in the next place, they had treated them very harshly. No doubt they were in the wrong—not quite, however; and the honest fellow was tormented by the thought that he might have fought against the righteous cause. Sénécal, who was immured in the Tuileries, under the terrace at the water's edge, had none of this mental anguish.

There were nine hundred men in the place, huddled together in the midst of filth, without the slightest order, their faces blackened with powder and clotted blood, shivering with ague and breaking out into cries of rage, and those who were brought there to die were not separated from the rest. Sometimes, on hearing the sound of a detonation, they believed that they were all going to be shot. Then they dashed themselves against the walls, and after that fell back again into their places, so much stupefied by suffering that it seemed to them that they were living in a nightmare, a mournful hallucination. The lamp, which hung from the arched roof, looked like a stain of blood, and little green and yellow flames fluttered about, caused by the emanations from the vault. Through fear of epidemics, a commission was appointed. When he had advanced a few steps, the President recoiled, frightened by the stench from the excrements and from the corpses.

As soon as the prisoners drew near a vent-hole, the National Guards who were on sentry, in order to prevent them from shaking the bars of the grating, prodded them indiscriminately with their bayonets.

As a rule they showed no pity. Those who were not beaten wished to signalise themselves. There was a regular outbreak of fear. They avenged themselves at the same time on newspapers, clubs, mobs, speech-making—everything that had exasperated them during the last three months, and in spite of the victory that had been gained, equality (as if for the punishment of its defenders and the exposure of its enemies to ridicule) manifested itself in a triumphal fashion—an equality of brute beasts, a dead level of sanguinary vileness; for the fanaticism of self-interest balanced the madness of want, aristocracy had the same fits of fury as low debauchery, and the cotton cap did not show itself less hideous than the red cap. The public mind was agitated just as it would be after great convulsions of nature. Sensible men were rendered imbeciles for the rest of their lives on account of it.

Père Roque had become very courageous, almost foolhardy. Having arrived on the 26th at Paris with some of the inhabitants of Nogent, instead of going back at the same time with them, he had gone to give his assistance to the National Guard encamped at the Tuileries; and he was quite satisfied to be placed on sentry in front of the terrace at the water's side. There, at any rate, he had these brigands under his feet! He was delighted to find that they were beaten and humiliated, and he could not refrain from uttering invectives against them.

One of them, a young lad with long fair hair, put his face to the bars, and asked for bread. M. Roque ordered him to hold his tongue. But the young man repeated in a mournful tone:

""Bread!""

""Have I any to give you?""

Other prisoners presented themselves at the vent-hole, with their bristling beards, their burning eyeballs, all pushing forward, and yelling:

""Bread!""

Père Roque was indignant at seeing his authority slighted. In order to frighten them he took aim at them; and, borne onward into the vault by the crush that nearly smothered him, the young man, with his head thrown backward, once more exclaimed:

""Bread!""

""Hold on! here it is!"" said Père Roque, firing a shot from his gun. There was a fearful howl—then, silence. At the side of the trough something white could be seen lying.

After this, M. Roque returned to his abode, for he had a house in the Rue Saint-Martin, which he used as a temporary residence; and the injury done to the front of the building during the riots had in no slight degree contributed to excite his rage. It seemed to him, when he next saw it, that he had exaggerated the amount of damage done to it. His recent act had a soothing effect on him, as if it indemnified him for his loss.

It was his daughter herself who opened the door for him. She immediately made the remark that she had felt uneasy at his excessively prolonged absence. She was afraid that he had met with some misfortune—that he had been wounded.

This manifestation of filial love softened Père Roque. He was astonished that she should have set out on a journey without Catherine.

""I sent her out on a message,"" was Louise's reply.

And she made enquiries about his health, about one thing or another; then, with an air of indifference, she asked him whether he had chanced to come across Frederick:

""No; I didn't see him!""

It was on his account alone that she had come up from the country.

Some one was walking at that moment in the lobby.

""Oh! excuse me——""

And she disappeared.

Catherine had not found Frederick. He had been several days away, and his intimate friend, M. Deslauriers, was now living in the provinces.

Louise once more presented herself, shaking all over, without being able to utter a word. She leaned against the furniture.

""What's the matter with you? Tell me—what's the matter with you?"" exclaimed her father.

She indicated by a wave of her hand that it was nothing, and with a great effort of will she regained her composure.

The keeper of the restaurant at the opposite side of the street brought them soup. But Père Roque had passed through too exciting an ordeal to be able to control his emotions. ""He is not likely to die;"" and at dessert he had a sort of fainting fit. A doctor was at once sent for, and he prescribed a potion. Then, when M. Roque was in bed, he asked to be as well wrapped up as possible in order to bring on perspiration. He gasped; he moaned.

""Thanks, my good Catherine! Kiss your poor father, my chicken! Ah! those revolutions!""

And, when his daughter scolded him for having made himself ill by tormenting his mind on her account, he replied:

""Yes! you are right! But I couldn't help it! I am too sensitive!""

Guess the idea of that lobby empty do not sit with me well
It’s not your fault they try get me cause I'ma need the sales
Cause I'm selfish, and I need you to myself
Tryna see you afloat, but don't wanna see you excel
Cause I failed and see you 'bout to cry
Cause when I enter they city they leave without they pride
I'm sorry, and you starin' at my comments
Fearin' it's gone always be you sharin' me with all them
Wrong, how dare I say ignore them?
Preparing for that day I leave you here and switch you for them
It's hard, you know temptation and all
Bitches out here tryna see if my relationship's strong

The idea of me finding love, would run somebody off
And true my wall could use some plaques, but still I gotta floss
Brush you off, see I'm kinda lost
Now I'm up in the club with a couple of move ons
And dark, good nigga, troubled heart
Went from fallin' in love to drunk and fallin' apart
This is hard, tryna find some time to move on
Cause when we lost our baby, I got shady, shit got too dark
Soft, and I thank you baby, you strong
My ex before you married too, you solo, I say so long
Nah, good terms how that ended
But it surely put a dent on how I worry about this business
Off white picket fences, on flights with the children
On site stealin' kisses on off nights my intentions but

I'll fuck you right, have you walkin' from side to side (Hey)
How many times?

[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown, DJ Khaled, Chris Brown & DJ Khaled, Chris Brown & Big Sean]
Pour a cup for the bitches that ain't scared to get down
Get down, get down, oh-woah

Light another for the bitches who just only in town (In town, in town)
For the weekend, oh
How many times?

[Verse 3: Chris Brown, DJ Khaled]
I see these bitches in Supperclub
Niggas got me throwin' bottles up
Bottles with all of my homies
I'm feelin' generous, throwin' my money
She said she wanted the molly love
I gave her the dick, but I'm not in love
I call out, ""Bingo"" the minute I'm bonin'
Soon as I'm done, kick her out in the mornin'
Got Xans when I turn up, it's a party, bust it open
Pop that pussy in a circle, go retarded, pop it for me
She got that booty galore, grippin' it, backin' me up
You wanna fuck with a thug
Now I see all these bitches got ass and they throwin'
Damn, it's just a matter of time 'fore I'm gone
Drinkin' CÎROC and I know that she got it for free
I hit up Diddy, he told me he did it
He said that the liquor just bring out the freaks
Them bitches lit, droppin' that ass to a split
Talkin' 'bout me, I'm the shit
I just get down for the money, the bitches, and cars
And my niggas, they whippin' the bricks, huh
(Another one)
[Chorus: Chris Brown, Lil Wayne, DJ Khaled]
How-how-how-how-how many times I gotta tell that ass to come over? (How many times?)
How many times I gotta? (Live life, I gotta tell yo' ass)
How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over? (Over)

2015,King Kunta,Kendrick Lamar,"[Produced by Sounwave; Additional production by Terrace Martin]
[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
I got a bone to pick
I don't want you monkey-mouth motherfuckers
Sittin' in my throne again
Ayy, ayy, nigga, what's happenin'?
K-Dot back in the hood, nigga!
I'm mad (He mad!), but I ain't stressin'
True friends, one question

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
When you got the yams—(What's the yams?)

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
The yam is the power that be
You can smell it when I'm walkin' down the street
(Oh yes, we can, oh yes, we can)
I can dig rappin', but a rapper with a ghostwriter?
What the fuck happened? (Oh no!)
I swore I wouldn't tell, but most of y'all sharing bars
Like you got the bottom bunk in a two-man cell (A two-man cell)
Something's in the water (Something's in the water)
And if I gotta brown-nose for some gold
Then I'd rather be a bum than a motherfuckin' baller (Oh yeah!)

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
The yam brought it out of Richard Pryor
Manipulated Bill Clinton with desires
Twenty-four-seven, three-sixty-five days times two
I was contemplatin' gettin' off stage
Just to go back to the hood, see my enemy, and say… (Oh yeah)

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]

Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
You goat-mouth mammyfucker
I was gonna kill a couple rappers, but they did it to themselves
Everybody's suicidal, they ain't even need my help
This shit is elementary, I'll probably go to jail
If I shoot at your identity and bounce to the left
Stuck a flag in my city, everybody's screamin', ""Compton!""
I should probably run for mayor when I'm done, to be honest
And I put that on my momma and my baby boo too
Twenty million walkin' out the court buildin', woo-woo!
Aw, yeah, fuck the judge
I made it past twenty-five, and there I was
A little nappy-headed nigga with the world behind him
Life ain't shit but a fat vagina
Screamin', ""Annie, are you okay? Annie, are you okay?""
Limo tinted with the gold plates
Straight from the bottom, this the belly of the beast
From a peasant to a prince to a motherfuckin' king (Oh yeah)

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'—*Gunshot*
By the time you hear the next pop
The funk shall be within you—*Gunshot*
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
King Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah

2015,Crash And Burn,Thomas Rhett,"[Verse 1]
So I guess it's over, baby, déjà vu again
Who'd have thought that time don't stop?
And somehow, girl, the world keeps spinnin'
And guess I've turned myself into a solitary man
Ain't like I'm the only one that's in the shoes that I am

[Chorus]
Do you hear that? (Do you hear that?)
I'm right back (I'm right back)
At the sound of lonely callin'
Do you hear that? (Do you hear that?)
It's where I'm at (It's where I'm at)
It's the sound of teardrops fallin' down, down
A slammin' door and a lesson learned
I let another lover crash and burn

[Verse 2]
I know that it might sound jaded and I have to say
I think love is overrated, but I don't like throwin' it away
I know you could probably tell me right where I went wrong
Some guys can't have all the luck if others don't sing sad songs

[Chorus]
Do you hear that? (Do you hear that?)
I'm right back (I'm right back)

Do you hear that? (Do you hear that?)

You said you loved me for me?
Cause lately it seems the girl of your dreams
Is someone that I can't be
Oh but I try
And oh I cry

You know the ones she framed late last spring of you and her in Florida

""Ain't you good for anything?"" and you say

Every week has a weekend, by this time Friday night
You want a margarita, I'll get Tequila and ice

How come I'm never able to identify where it's comin' from?
I'd make a candle out of it, if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one
It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
Same clothes, homegrown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam

First-generation ghetto nigga
Cole world, hello niggas
Made it out the city with my head on straight
Niggas keep shootin' up the lead out
Young Jordan Peele, gotta get out
And the shit that I spit out
Is a cheat code like I'm facin' a RICO
And how a nigga put a hit out
And another one, and, and another one
I got like a hundred of 'em
'Bout to lap niggas so they think they ahead of me
But I'm really in front of them
Now some of them fumblin' they bags
Fuckin' up the little crumbs that they had
A reminder to humble yourself
This shit could be gone in an instant
Me, I'm runnin' long distance, all pistons firin'
I been stuck between maybe retirin'
And feelin' like I'm just not hittin' my prime
These days seein' rappers be dyin'
Way before they even gettin' they shine
I never even heard of lil' buddy
'Til somebody murdered lil' buddy
Now I'm on the phone, searchin' lil' buddy name
Got to playin' his tunes
All day in my room, thinkin', ""Damn
This shit wicked, to get they names buzzin'
Some niggas just gotta go lay in a tomb""
And media thirsty for clicks
I got a new rule
If you ain't never posted a rapper when he was alive
You can't post about him after he get hit
It's simple, it's the principle
On any tempo, I'm invincible
Don't even rap, I just vent to you
I rather that than an interview most days
Fuck 'em all like I'm goin' through a ho phase
Young nigga shoot out the whip like road rage
I pray all of my dawgs stay so paid
And the only thing that kill 'em is old age

Startin' from zero, got nothin' to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me, myself, I got nothin' to prove

You got a fast car
And I got a plan to get us out of here
I've been workin' at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just across thе border and into the city
And you and I can both get jobs
Finally see what it mеans to be livin'

[Verse 3]
See, my old man's got a problem
He live in the bottle, that's the way it is
He said his body's too old for working
His body's too young to look like his
So Mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give

Y tus ojos grandes, me perdí en un laberinto

But I hope that you takin' a little time for yourself

Between the hectic sounds of your precious baby cryin'
Do you clear your mind? Must be a lot goin' on

Seem like I keep cryin' off so much since a nigga had these kids
And I don't know what it is that made me so sensitive

In hopes that you smile, forgettin' the stress that piles from all the above
The more that we hurt, the harder we love

Y por todo el bulevar
Con mi compa Flaco arremangando
Unos huaraches, mi gorra de lado
Por la Zapata, el Gordo trae el mando
Tirando línea con Manny y el Caña
A la orden pa'l desorden conectado
Y mi RT en Acapulco
Y si hay pedo, los sepulto
Aquí no andamos haciendo bulto
Al chingazo yo resulto
Y una glockzona que va conmigo
Siempre lista para un susto

Y que sigan llegando las pacas
Su compa Chinito
Puro Apaseo el Alto

[Verso 2]
Y mi compa Mario que nunca me ha deja'o
Unas banquetearas a veces tomando
Y mi compa Power y también el Mau
Me hacen segunda, nunca me han dejado
Y mi compa Sapo, si hay pedo, él brinca
A la orden en una a tirar vergazos
Y acá la envidia al chile que no existe
Y pa' qué les cuento si no tiene chiste
Yo soy el Gordo, para que se ubiquen

We get it poppin', leave nothin' in the store
