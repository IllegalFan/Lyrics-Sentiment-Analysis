2021,Good 4 U,Olivia Rodrigo,"[Intro]
(Ah)

[Verse 1]
Well, good for you, I guess you moved on really easily
You found a new girl and it only took a couple weeks
Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world?
(World)
And good for you, I guess that you've been workin' on yourself
I guess that therapist I found for you, she really helped
Now you can be a better man for your brand-new girl (Girl)

[Chorus]
Well, good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doin' great out there without me, baby
God, I wish that I could do that
I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you

[Verse 2]
Well, good for you, I guess you're gettin' everything you want (Ah)
You bought a new car and your career's really takin' off (Ah)
It's like we never even happened
Baby, what the fuck is up with that? (Ah)
And good for you, it's like you never even met me
Remember when you swore to God I was the only
Person who ever got you? Well, screw that, and screw you
You will never have to hurt the way you know that I do

2021,Deja Vu,Olivia Rodrigo,"[Verse 1]
Car rides to Malibu
Strawberry ice cream, one spoon for two
And tradin' jackets
Laughin’ 'bout how small it looks on you
(Ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha)
Watching reruns of Glee
Bein' annoying, singin’ in harmony
I bet she's braggin' to all her friends, sayin' you're so unique, hmm

[Chorus]
So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks it's special, but it's all reused
That was our place, I found it first
I made the jokes you tell to her when she's with you
Do you get déjà vu when she’s with you?
Do you get déjà vu? (Ah) Hmm
Do you get déjà vu, huh?

[Verse 2]
Do you call her, almost say my name?
’Cause let's be honest, we kinda do sound the same
Another actress
I hate to think that I was just your type
And I bet that she knows Billy Joel
’Cause you played her ""Uptown Girl""
You're singin' it together
Now I bet you even tell her how you love her
In between the chorus and the verse (Ooh; I love you)

If you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy
And I can take you for a ride

You met me at the perfect time

In the east wing and the west wing
Of this mansion, what's happenin'?

Nights alone that we miss more
And days we save as souvenirs

And give you my whole life
I left my girl, I’m in Mallorca
Hate to leave her, call it torture
Remember when I couldn’t hold her
Left her baggage for Rimowa

Then I might bе onto somethin'
I ain't givin' you one in public
I'm givin' you hundreds, fuck it
Somethin' we just gotta get into
Sign first, middle, last on the wisdom tooth
Niggas wishin' that the pussy was a kissin' booth

And that dinner just like dessert too
And when we French, refresh, give me two
When I bite that lip, come get me too
He want lipstick, lip gloss, hickeys too, huh

Brown guilty eyes and little white lies, yeah
I played dumb, but I always knew
That you talked to her, maybe did even worse
I kept quiet so I could keep you

[Pre-Chorus]
And ain't it funny how you ran to her
The second that we called it quits?
And ain't it funny how you said you were friends?
Now it sure as hell don't look like it

[Chorus]
You betrayed me
And I know that you'll never feel sorry
For the way I hurt, yeah
You talked to her when we were together
Loved you at your worst, but that didn't matter
It took you two weeks to go off and date her
Guess you didn't cheat, but you're still a traitor

[Verse 2]
Now you bring her around just to shut me down
Show her off like she's a new trophy
And I know if you were true, there's no damn way that you
Could fall in love with somebody that quickly

Just like we always talked about
'Cause you were so excited for me
To finally drive up to your house
But today, I drove through the suburbs
Crying 'cause you weren't around

And you're probably with that blonde girl
Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?

[Chorus]
And I know we weren't perfect, but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

[Verse 3]
And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you, but
I kinda feel sorry for them

2021,Brutal,Olivia Rodrigo,"[Intro]
I want it to be, like, messy

[Verse 1]
I'm so insecure, I think
That I'll die before I drink
And I'm so caught up in the news
Of who likes me and who hates you
And I'm so tired that I might
Quit my job, start a new life
And they'd all be so disappointed
'Cause who am I if not exploited?
And I'm so sick of seventeen
Where's my fucking teenage dream?
If someone tells me one more time
""Enjoy your youth,"" I'm gonna cry
And I don't stick up for myself
I'm anxious, and nothing can help
And I wish I'd done this before
And I wish people liked me more

[Chorus]
All I did was try my best
This the kinda thanks I get?

And I hate every song I write
And I'm not cool, and I'm not smart
And I can't even parallel park

'Cause I thought you'd like me more
If I looked like the other prom queens
I know that you loved before
Tried so hard to be everything that you liked
Just for you to say you're not the compliment type

[Verse 2]
And I knew how you took your coffee
And your favorite songs by heart
I read all of your self-help books
So you'd think that I was smart
Stupid, emotional, obsessive little me
I knew from the start this is exactly how you'd leave

[Chorus]
You found someonе more exciting, the nеxt second, you were gone
And you left me there cryin', wonderin' what I did wrong
And you always say I'm never satisfied, but I don't think that's true
'Cause all I ever wanted was to be enough for you
Yeah, all I ever wanted was to be enough for you

[Verse 3]
And maybe I'm just not as interesting
As the girls you had before
But God, you couldn't have cared less
About someone who loved you more
I'd say you broke my heart
But you broke much more than that
Now, I don't want your sympathy
I just want myself back

Does she mean you forgot about me?

An eternal love bullshit you know you'll never mean

2021,Rapstar,Polo G,"[Intro]
(Shout out my nigga Synco)

[Chorus]
Uh (Tuned up), copped a BMW, new deposit, I picked up another bag
Like fuck it, I'ma count while I'm in it
I hear planes flyin', crowds screamin', money counters, chains clangin'
Shit, I guess that's how it sound when you winnin'
I ain't jokin', do it sound like I'm kiddin'?
I been makin' like two thousand a minute
So high up through the clouds, I was swimmin'
I'm probably gon' drown when I'm in it
I bet she gon' get loud when I'm in it
And we might have a child when I'm finished

[Verse 1]
Uh, I won't love a ho, after we fuck, she can't get near me
Only bitch I give a conversation to is Siri
My pants Amiri, yes, I'm winnin', clearly
I'm the chosen one, seen my potential, so they fear me
Lately I've been prayin', God, I wonder, can You hear me?
Thinkin' 'bout the old me, I swear I miss you dearly
Stay down 'til you come up, I've been stickin' to that theory
Every day a battle, I'm exhausted and I'm weary
Make sure I smile in public, when alone, my eyes teary
I fought through it all, but that shit hurt me severely
I've been gettin' high to hide behind my insecurities
Takin' different pills, but I know it ain't gon'—

They say I'm Pac rebirth, never put out a weak verse
Homicides when we lurk, I'ma step 'til my feet hurt
Been puttin' them streets first
White tees turned burgundy t-shirts
Lookin' for somethin' real, he stuck in a deep search
Anxiety killin' me, I just want to leave Earth
When they ask if I'm okay, it just make everything seem worse
Try and explain your feelings, sound like something you rehearsed
Stabbed me in my back with a clean smirk
Lookin' so deep into your eyes, I can read your thoughts, so
Shut the fuck—, I mean, please don't talk
I done been through too much and I don't need another loss
Put that on every war scar for every battle I fought

2021,Favorite Crime,Olivia Rodrigo,"[Verse 1]
Know that I loved you so bad
I let you treat me like that
I was your willing accomplice, honey
And I watched as you fled the scene
Doe-eyed as you buried me
One heart broke, four hands bloody

The things I did
Just so I could call you mine
The things you did
Well, I hope I was your favorite crime

[Verse 2]
You used me as an alibi
I crossed my heart as you crossed the line
And I defended you to all my friends
And now every time a siren sounds
I wondеr if you're around
'Cause you know that I'd do it all again

2021,"1 Step Forward, 3 Steps Back",Olivia Rodrigo,"[Verse 1]
Called you on the phone today
Just to ask you how you were
All I did was speak normally
Somehow, I still struck a nerve
You got me fucked up in the head, boy
Never doubted myself so much
Like, am I pretty? Am I fun, boy?
I hate that I give you power over that kinda stuff
[Chorus]
'Cause it's always one step forward and three steps back
I'm the love of your life until I make you mad
It's always one step forward and three steps back
Do you love me, want me, hate me?
Boy, I don't understand
No, I don't understand

[Verse 2]
And maybe in some masochistic way
I kind of find it all exciting
Like, which lover will I get today?
Will you walk me to the door or send me home crying?
[Chorus]
It's one step forward and three steps back
I'm the love of your life until I make you mad
It's always one step forward and three steps back

2021,Forever After All,Luke Combs,"[Verse 1]
A cold beer's got twelve ounces
A good truck's got maybe three hundred thousand
You only get so much until it's gone
Duracells in a Maglite
A needle drop on a forty-five
Are the kinda things that only last so long

[Pre-Chorus]
When the new wears off, and they get to gettin' old
Sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll

[Chorus]
They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a T-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all

[Verse 2]
The FM station on the outskirts
Blue jeans after years of shift work
All fadin' out like I always knew they would
The strings on this guitar
The first love lost on a young heart
Those things are gonna break after the getting's good

2021,Blinding Lights,The Weeknd,"[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I've been tryna call
I've been on my own for long enough
Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
I'm goin' through withdrawals
You don't even have to do too much
You can turn me on with just a touch, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
I look around and
Sin City's cold and empty (Oh)
No one's around to judge me (Oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone

[Chorus]
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
Hey, hey, hey

[Verse 2]

2021,Beautiful Mistakes,Maroon 5 Featuring Megan Thee Stallion,"[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
It's beautiful, it's bittersweet
You're like a broken home to me
I take a shot of memories
And black out like an empty street
I fill my days with the way you walk
And fill my nights with broken dreams
I make up lies inside my head
Like one day, you'll come back to me

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Now I'm not holdin' on, not holdin' on
I'm just depressed that you're gone
Not holdin' on, not holdin' on

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Beautiful mistakes
I make inside my head
She's naked in my bed
And now we lie awake
Makin' beautiful mistakes
I wouldn't take 'еm back
I'm in love with the past
And now we liе awake
Makin' beautiful mistakes

It's pitiful, I can't believe
How every day gets worse for me
I take a break, I cut you off
To keep myself from lookin' soft
I fill my nights with the way you was
And still wake up with broken dreams
I make these lies inside my head
Feel like they're my reality

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Now I'm not holdin' on, not holdin' on

Doin' somethin' different, got me lookin' stupid (Damn)
The only way I'm comin' back to you is if you dreamin' lucid (Hmm)
Prove it, if you made a promise then keep it (Keep it)
Why you wanna lie and then get mad? I don't believe it (Boy, bye)
But really, I was doin' just fine without ya
Lookin' fine, sippin' wine, dancin' on club couches (Ah)
Baby, why you wanna lose me like you don't need me? (Don't need me)
Like I don't block you and you still try to reach me (Still try to reach me)
How you figure out how to call me from the TV? (Huh?)
You runnin' outta chances and this time I mean it (Ah)

[Bridge: Megan Thee Stallion]
Yeah, bet you miss my love, all in your bed (Bed)
Now you're stressin' out, pullin' your hair (Hair)
Smellin' your pillows and wishin' I was there (I was there)
Slidin' down the shower wall, lookin' sad (Sad)
I know it's hard to let go, I'm the best (I'm the best)
Best you ever had and best you gon' get (Gon' get)
And if we break up, I don't wanna be friends (Be friends)

I kinda wanna throw my phone across the room
'Cause all I see are girls too good to be true
With paper-white teeth and perfect bodies
Wish I didn't care

I know their beauty's not my lack
But it feels like that weight is on my back
And I can't let it go

Hit him with that good good

Broke boys don't deserve no pussy

I'm forever poppin' shit, pullin' up and droppin' shit

Put it on him now, he will never be the same (He won't)

2021,Hope Ur OK,Olivia Rodrigo,"[Verse 1]
I knew a boy once when I was small
A towhead blond with eyes of salt
He played the drum in the marching band
His parents cared more about the Bible
Than being good to their own child
He wore long sleeves 'cause of his dad
And somehow, we fell out of touch
Hope he took his bad deal and made a royal flush
Don't know if I'll see you again someday
But if you're out there, I hope that you're okay

[Verse 2]
My middle school friend grew up alone
She raised her brothers on hеr own
Her parents hated who shе loved
She couldn't wait to go to college
She was tired 'cause she was brought into a world
Where family was merely blood
Does she know how proud I am she was created
With the courage to unlearn all of their hatred?
We don't talk much, but I just gotta say
I miss you and I hope that you're okay

[Bridge]
Address the letters to the holes in my butterfly wings
Nothing's forever, nothing is as good as it seems
And when the clouds won't iron out
And the monsters creep into your house
And every door is hard to close

Still got your things here
And they stare at me like souvenirs
Don't wanna let you out my head

Said that you love me, but that'll last for never
It's cold outside like when you walked out my life
Why you walk out my life?

Face shots to the face, don't trip on your lace

He made that sharp turn, woadie spot 'em, peeled the car
Had a mask on, Draco make 'em beat box

In Miami with my motherfuckin' heat out
With another nigga bitch, said she got her feet out
I walked in the party, I'm on my big four shit
Ready to get it started, bitch, I got no sense
Oh, he the plug, ridin' 'round with four bricks
Call me Kobe, twenty-four on me
Can't fuck wit' her no more, bad lil' bitch, she do the most
I get my groove on every time I see them folks
I got the antidote, I'm thinking that's something you need to know
I'm smooth and I'm cold, she know my wrist on froze
Skinny jeans on with a big bankroll
She playin' my song, I got her takin' off her thong
I'm tryna get it on, she feeling all over my Peter bone
Two rights don't make a wrong, it just go on and on

Girl, you killing me, you tweakin' hard (Girl, you tweakin')
I asked you what you feel and you don't speak at all (Oh no)
But you go straight to Twitter, you gon' tweet it all (Oh why?)

(Tay Keith, this too hard)
We The Best Music
(Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up)
Another one
DJ Khaled

[Verse 1: Lil Baby & Lil Durk]
Scratched a million off my checklist three years ago
Add two zeros to the one, I'm in a different mode
This my life, do what I want, I be with different hoes
You know the pick and roll, I picked her up and sent her home
I got rich off strong, we get ’em in and get 'em gone
You know Trappy just got out, I ain't have to put him on
We the ones who got the numbers, who put the city on
It’s the middle of the summer, I got a hoodie on
My demon time ain't nothin' nice
I try not to wear nothin' twice
I came up off of shootin' dice, yeah
My lil' brother ain't livin' right
My sis’ and ’em doin' aight
My cuz and ’em still servin' life, yeah
Seen a robber rob a deacon
I seen a preacher get caught for cheatin'
I'll break the bank for one of my people
I said, ""I’m the one,"" they didn't believe me
I show 'em the facts, now they all need me
I'ma get cake as long as I'm breathin'
They makin' it hard, this shit really easy, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You might also like[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I'ma turn up on a hater every chance that I get
I want the biggest watch that they got, don't care if that shit hurt my wrist
All these hoes fuck on us all, I wish I would claim that bitch
They get hard when they get guns, we got a hood full of sticks
Soon as they say we can't come, you know we'll run 'round that bitch
You can miss me with that shit, you know I live in the mix (Money, cars and clothes and hoes)
You know I live in the mix (Money, cars and clothes and hoes)

[Verse 2: Lil Baby, DJ Khaled & Lil Durk]
Yeah, she think I'm a regular rapper, I'm not
One person come tell me we fuckin', you blocked
Watch me run this shit to the tippity-top, yeah (Keep goin')
Put my kids in Givenchy
She must think one plus one is three
I can't support your personal needs
She don't got a mortgage, moved in with her niece
These niggas be cappin', them cars be leased
Youngest in charge, I speak for the streets
I was nodding off, they woke up a beast
Struggle what made me, we used to have water for dinner, we didn't have nothin' to eat
Soon as I get on his ass, they gon' look at me better, like, ""Damn, he was fuckin' with me,"" yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I'ma turn up on a hater every chance that I get
I want the biggest watch that they got, don't care if that shit hurt my wrist
All these hoes fuck on us all, I wish I would claim that bitch
They get hard when they get guns, we got a hood full of sticks
Soon as they say we can't come, you know we'll run 'round that bitch
You can miss me with that shit, you know I live in the mix (Money, cars and clothes and hoes)
You know I live in the mix (Money, cars and clothes and hoes)
[Verse 3: Lil Durk]
I'm from the trenches
Niggas be tough on the 'net, but really be there for attention
Well, bitches be talkin' like they really rich, but really be beggin' me under my pictures
I'll give her forty, fifty thousand cash to start up a business
I'll spend that shit at the dentist
I'd rather fuck her and pay up her rent for a year just to get out of her feelings
I'm in the Lambo' truck in my hood, nobody gon' tell me shit
Goin' to Cali, I pick up my weed for sure, nobody gon' mail me shit
Dice game, Craps and Cee-Lo, I need cash, don't sell me shit
Baby got his hood on smash, yeah, you can tell they really rich
Drop the lo', ain't no room right now, I took her to the O
Then I pulled up on the Lam' 'cause she a fan of Boonie Moe
I got the city on lock, uh, fuckin' up all the opps
I be around with three million dollars in jewelry, I'm standin' on all the blocks
This the anthem, mmm-hmm
Droppin' the six in the Fanta, mmm
Black Rolls truck with the all-white seats, remind me of sittin' on panda, mmm
I love my cousin, she was a dancer
I love my brother, he was a scammer
Sittin' on my lap 'cause I'm pullin' her tracks and I fuck from the back 'cause she callin' me handsome (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I'ma turn up on a hater every chance that I get
I want the biggest watch that they got, don't care if that shit hurt my wrist
All these hoes fuck on us all, I wish I would claim that bitch
They get hard when they get guns, we got a hood full of sticks
Soon as they say we can't come, you know we'll run 'round that bitch
You can miss me with that shit, you know I live in the mix (Money, cars and clothes and hoes)

2021,Wockesha,Moneybagg Yo,"[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, I kinda put the cup down for a minute but umm
But honestly, it ain't nobody's business what's in my cup, what's in your cup, what's in they cup
It's your cup, drink it
So whatever the hell was in my cup, the only reaction I did was got more popular, more successful
Than a lot more things that I've ever done, I probably should pick that cup back up (Haha)

[Verse 1]
I'm sittin' here lookin' at Keisha, like, ""Do you love me, do you love me not?""
Damn, you hit the spot
Taste like candy (Candy), sweet like fruit (Ooh)
Wet like water, can I love on you?
Withdrawals, I'm feelin' different, every day I need a dose
Every now and thеn I'm missin', I got my times when I go ghost
But she minе (Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm), I'm stampin' her
Priority status, so them other bitches mad at her (Too mad, ha)
Thumbin' through a hunnid thou', I spent that times two on you
Caught myself cuttin' you loose, then I pop back up like peekaboo
Here I go, flyer than most, Louis V coat
Gas station, coffee cup full, I don't drive boats, no
Money can't buy happiness but she found love inside a G
Head and somethin' to eat, that's all a thug nigga need
No lie you get me higher than the prices on my weed
I'm displayin' my feelings like I'm wearing 'em on my sleeve (See)

[Pre-Chorus]
One minute I'm done with you, the next one I be runnin' back
Go your way, I go my way but somehow we be still attached
Tryna find my answers with this cup, but ain't no truth in that
They be like, I'm dumb for fuckin' with you, I spend stupid racks
You might also like[Chorus]
I'm sittin' here knowing I don't need ya pouring O's in the liter
Sippin' chaser with my reefer, can't get my mind off Wockesha
Watch me put my heart in this cup
In my feelings, she my therapist, I'ma talk to this cup (I swear)

[Verse 2]
Ring around the rose-z, cup full of OZ's
I hope I don't OD, she keep sayin', ""Pour me""
Turn me to that purple demon emoji (Devil)
Fuck me like you miss me, it's been a whole week
This ain't no playground love, we grown (Too grown)
I'm too fucked up, I paid four hunnid for a zone (That strong)
My bitch don't like you, you've been fuckin' up my home (In my house)
Relapsin' every time I try to leave you 'lone (I relapse, girl)
Every nigga in the street lookin' for her but she rare
Dark skin, purple hair, stingy, with her hard to share (I can't)
Never needed nobody but it feel good to have somebody (That somebody)
Drop you and pick you up whenever I feel like it
This shit toxic
Let me know if you feel me, hmm-hmm (Hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm, hmm)
I gotta stop it, I must stop it

[Pre-Chorus]
One minute I'm done with you, the next one I be runnin' back
Go your way, I go my way but somehow we be still attached
Tryna find my answers with this cup, but ain't no truth in that
They be like, I'm dumb for fuckin' with you, I spend stupid racks
[Chorus]
I'm sittin' here knowing I don't need ya pouring O's in the liter

(Last night, all I think about is you)
(Don't stop, baby, you can walk through)
(Don't want, baby, think about you)
(You know that I'm never gonna lose)
Road shimmer wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a mirror
Road shimmer wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a—

[Chorus]
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

[Verse 1]
Usually, I put somethin' on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today, I see our reflections clearly
In Hollywood, layin' on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need somethin' I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now, the night has come, but

[Verse 2]
You can't fight it, you can't breathe
You say somethin' so lovin', but
Now I gotta let you go
You'll be better off in someone new
I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I say goodbye

[Chorus]
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
[Bridge]
I just wonder what you're dreamin' of
When you sleep and smile so comfortable
I just wish that I could give you that
That look that's perfectly un-sad
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Heat waves been fakin' me out

[Chorus]
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

2021,Hell Of A View,Eric Church,"[Verse 1]
I was no daddy's dream, was not your mama's prayer
But I was your first and your last ticket out of there
I caught your wings on fire when I smoked my Bronco tires
Out of that town

[Verse 2]
I'm good at rollin' dice, no good at standin' still
You liked the thought of chasin' life instead of dollar bills
We were livin' reckless, nothin' to catch us, baby
But the ground

[Chorus]
This ain't for everybody, toes hangin' off the ledge
Like we got nothin' to lose
Ain't always heaven, baby, this livin' on the edge
You holdin' me, holdin' you, it's a hell of a view

[Verse 3]
I paint with my old Gibson, you paint your purple sky
This town's our canvas, baby, let's paint it red tonight
Go out like shootin' stars, chasin' what's in our hearts
Into thе blue (Into the blue)

[Chorus]
This ain't for еverybody, toes hangin' off the ledge
Like we got nothin' to lose
Ain't always heaven, baby, this livin' on the edge

2021,The Good Ones,Gabby Barrett,"[Verse 1]
He's a phone call to his parents
He's a Bible by the bed
He's the T-shirt that I'm wearing
He's the song stuck in my head
He's solid and he's steady
Like the Allegheny runs
He knows just where he's going
And he's proud of where he's from

[Pre-Chorus]
One of the good ones
He's one of the good ones

[Chorus]
A love me like he should one
Like he wrote the book one
The kind you find when you don't even look one
Anybody can be good once
But he's good all the time
He's one of the good ones
And he's all mine
He's one of the good ones

[Verse 2]
You'll know him when you see him
By the way he looks at me
You'd say he hung the moon
I'd say he hung the galaxy
Nobody does it better
Oh, the way he pulls me in

But they all led me to him

2021,Wants And Needs,Drake Featuring Lil Baby,"[Intro: Drake]
(Six)
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah

[Verse 1: Drake]
Leave me out the comments, leave me out the nonsense
Speakin' out of context, people need some content
Niggas tryna keep up, shit is not a contest
Whippin' Benz concept
Heaven-sent, God-sent
Least that's what my mom says
Proof is in the progress, money's not a object
Busy than a motherfucker, you know how my job get
Barkin' up the wrong tree, you know how the dogs get
Haven't fallen off yet, yee
Come with a classic, they come around years later and say it's a sleeper
The earrings are real, the petty is real, might charge my ex for a feature
Deposit the money to Brenda, LaTisha, or Linda, Felicia
She came for me twice, I didn't even nut for her once, you know I'm a pleaser
Forty-two millimeter, was made in Geneva
Yeah, I probably should go to Yeshiva, we went to Ibiza
Yeah, I probably should go link with Yeezy, I need me some Jesus
But soon as I started confessin' my sins, he wouldn't believe us
You might also like[Chorus: Drake]
Sins, I got sins on my mind
And some M's, got a lot of M's on my mind
And my friends, yeah, I keep my friends on my mind
I'm in love, I'm in love with two girls at one time
And they tens, that's why I got ten on my mind
I got M's, got a lot of M's on my mind
And my friends, yeah, I keep my friends on my mind
Should repent, I need me some Jesus in my life
Amen

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
I'm from the four, but I love me a threesome
DM her, delete it, she my lil' secret
He tryna diss me to blow up, I peep it
I can't respond, we just go at your people
If I left some racks on the bed, you can keep it
This shit gettin' deeper and deeper, I dig it
My shovel wasn't bent, I was broke, had to fix it
A shark in the water, you swim with the lil' fishes
I hit today, by tomorrow, she miss it
I grab her neck, she look up, then I kiss it
I'm not a GOAT, but I fit the description
I like to pour, so I get the prescription
We walk around with them bands in our britches
This gun ain't gon' jam, when I blow, I ain't missin'
I'm droppin' hit after hit, I'm just chillin'
But I'll send a hit while I chill with my children
Bigger the business, the bigger the office
I fucked 'round and found me a swag, then I caught up
They call for my artists, they makin' me offers
I don't even bargain, I'll start from the bottom
I lost a Ferrari, Las Vegas, Nevada
I woke up the followin' day and went harder
I'm crackin' my shell now, they see that I'm smarter
I gotta get money, I love to get charter
I gave her four Birkins and one's for her daughter (Skrrt)

2021,Breaking Up Was Easy In The 90's,Sam Hunt,"[Intro]
Yeah, man, oh man, oh man

[Verse 1]
Bartender looked at me like
""Pony up, man, we're closin' down""
I paid the tab, and I turned around
Got on that phone on the way home
And ended up down the rabbit hole again
It's funny how you haven't changed a bit
But you're twice as pretty
Glad you finally got to see New York City
And I know it's not a race
But it looks like you're gettin' over me
Faster than I'm gettin' over you
But hey, what you gon' do?

[Chorus]
I'm sick of sittin' at the house, dyin' on my phone
Wishin' I was somewhere I can be alone
Try to let you go, somethin' always reminds me
I bet breakin' up was easy in the '90s
I'm tired of gettin' drunk, tired of bein' free
Tired of seein' pictures I don't wanna see
Girl, you're everywhere, everywhere but behind me
I bet breakin' up was easy in the '90s
You might also like[Verse 2]
Back then, I could've convinced myself
That maybe you called when I was out
But you didn't know what to say, so you didn't leave a message
And that you're probably at home right now, sound asleep
'Cause goin' out isn't really your thing
And I wouldn't have a clue what you been up to lately
Or who you been up to it with
But when I don't miss your calls, I miss you callin'
And I go 'round and 'round again

[Chorus]
I'm sick of sittin' at the house, dyin' on my phone
Wishin' I was somewhere I can be alone
Try to let you go, somethin' always reminds me
I bet breakin' up was easy in the '90s
I'm tired of gettin' drunk, tired of bein' free
Tired of seein' pictures I don't wanna see
Girl, you're everywhere, everywhere but behind me
I bet breakin' up was easy in the '90s

[Bridge]
Modern love, it's the modern hearts breakin'
I'm just a product of my generation, and I
'Bout had enough, watchin' you gettin' on with your life
[Chorus]
Baby, I'm sick of sittin' at the house, dyin' on my phone
Wishin' I was somewhere I can be alone
I try to let you go, somethin' always reminds me
(I bet breakin' up was easy in the '90s)
I'm tired of gettin' drunk, tired of bein' free
Tired of seein' pictures I don't wanna see
Girl, you're everywhere, everywhere but behind me
I bet breakin' up was easy in the '90s

2021,Seeing Green,"Nicki Minaj, Drake & Lil Wayne","[Intro: Lil Wayne & Heather Headley]
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm smokin' tarantula (Yeah)
Bae gave it to me (Hmm)
You dig? Yeah, hold up, hm

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I'ma pull up so lit, I just might crash, dawg
Let me take this Balenciaga mask off to ask y'all, ""Who asked y'all?""
Cita told me to stunt my ass off, that's all
Bop-bop-bop-bop-bop, he was a good cat, my bad, dawg
Don't put no K after that B-Boy, ""Bad kall,"" that's flag talk
Fuck around and knock your flag off, I had to
I wore a Gat' before a tattoo, I had to
As a matter of fact, I had two
No cap, I'm on them capsules, I done relapsed, boo
But I been on my feet since Cinderella lost her glass shoe
The cash blue, but I'm still seein' green
I'm in the bathroom, and I'm peein' lean
My bitch a vacuum
I told her, ""Keep me clean,"" the scene serene
I'm a badonkadonk and bikini fiend
I just need a queen that ain't scared to fuck a Stephen King
I used to live next door to Drake and Momma Dee
And Lisa Dee on Eagle Street
How I go from bars on the screen door to the TV screen?
Don't ask me, but never change the channel
Gucci flannel, Gucci socks, Gucci sandals
Gucci teddy bears, and pandas, not fake
Propaganda 'bout to blow out the candle
My lil' ho out Atlanta, got a ho out Atlanta
With a ho out Atlanta, she a ho out Atlanta
We get it, it's the same in each city
My bitch dance better than P. Diddy's
And ever since the pandemic
They don't wanna let Drake out of Canada
I been screamin', ""Free Drizzy""
I know bae trust my vision but don't want me to see prison
Said, ""I can't make no promises, either leave or come visit
But leave the keys to your heart next to your soul and your spirit""
Some see graffiti as art, some could see hoes to be women
But I'm the greediest shark amongst an ocean of killers
I put you six feet deep, I'm bein' socially distant
Nina Ross on the hip, the .44 is my mistress
Extra shots, extra clips, ain't talkin' videos nor vixens
Just come and see about it, bitch
Tunechi
You might also like[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Ayo, I am the star in any room that I stand in
I am the standout, you just my stand-in
These bitches copy my homework, that's what they hand in
That's why I'm private like the airports I land in
Life is a beach house, don't let the sand in
I ball in any arena, go let the fans in
I should go cop a new jersey, that's word to Camden
These bitches' time tick-tockin', better stick to dancin'
I D&G the wallet, my money tall and brolic
Big-ass backyards, just so Papa Bear can frolic
One Margherita pizza with Parmesan and garlic
These bitches thirsty, I can see why they alcoholics
Ain't gotta ever talk about it when you are about it
Just bought a new car, not to drive it, but to walk around it
Just call me ""Nicki, cock the blicky,"" the Minaj is silent
Brand new vanilla Maserati, I been Häagen-Dazsin'
He call me solid even though I'm drippin', water diet
Big booty stickin' out, my Daisy Dukes'll cause a riot
These bitches still my sons, who could ever deny it?
My packs hit different, who could ever supply it?
No one bitch could be my opp, that shit offends me
It's corporate giants and machines that went against me
I wash bitches, man, they couldn't even rinse me
She said she hot, I said, ""Well, bitch, come and convince me""
Ain't no C in green, but I'm seein' green
Even with them floor seats, they couldn't see the team
The K-I-N-G, the G.O.A.T., plus me, the Queen
I send shots, send 'em back or flee the scene
[Break: Drake]
You know, one of the perils of makin' money is
You can afford to be dramatic
Y'all some drama queens, for real
It's all good, though
You now tuned in to the biggest ever
YMCMB, Tunechi Lee, Young Angel, Young Lion, man
Y'all boys get on a track with Onika Maraj, and y'all still dyin'
Man, what's up? We in this bitch

[Verse 3: Drake]
This ain't gon' be the first time that I do numbers on two crutches
Seen more plaques than toothbrushes
Until I'm at the pearly white gates, I gotta move somethin', do somethin'
All meetings happen in person, so they can't prove nothin'
Known her eight years and still fuck her like a new husband
Tryna run a country like Putin one day, but who's rushin', who's bluffin'? For real
Who you huggin', who you wanna be lovin'?
I play forty-eight minutes on a torn meniscus, who's subbin'?
El Chico luxury, wanna see my niggas ball so bad, I started up a league
Fuck with me, you niggas can't trouble me from the Doubletree
Step your suites up, I get Oliver to set the beats up
2021, I had to wet the streets up
Your girl was better in the mornin' like a slice of pizza
That's when I had to hit her with the, ""Nice to meet ya""
You niggas think you doin' damage, you just hypin' me up
Face who? I could see a wall of y'all, all of y'all and run straight through
Trust, it's all fun and games until I wanna play too
Ayy, dios mío, the ice is frío on the Jesus, it's bringin' me closer to God
I'm already close to the mob, I'm already known as the G.O.A.T
Could try and get close, but you won't, I already packed the garage
None of these shits is a Dodge, none of this shit's a facade
None of this shit's a mirage
Thought I was seein' things when I was seein' green

2021,On Me,Lil Baby,"[Intro]
(What's happenin', Chi Chi?)

[Verse 1]
Fill the bando up with bags, give the lil' bro them a job
You can come get rich with us, you gon' eat or you gon' starve?
Keep a certified hitter sittin', I pay him not to rob
Hop out 2020 Cullinan, I'm ridin' in the stars
Know some people hate that I'm on top, I bulletproofed the car
All the members made free bands off packs, live like they crackin' cards
Joe know for a fact I keep it real, he still ain't take the charge
Why she talkin' crazy 'bout me like I don't do more than my part?
I can't play with my creation, give the world to my lil' boys
I been savin' more than I been spendin', that's what I bе on
I'm a human, I'm not perfect, I know sometimеs I be wrong

[Chorus]
I'm like, ""Come and put that pussy on me, don't be runnin' from me""
If I like it, I spend money on it, get whatever from me
Put six figures in your business, I do real shit
I drop cash at the dealership, they'll mail you a pink slip
She make sure she keep her nails did and her wig fixed
Went to jail and that one held me down, she a real bitch
Hundred rounds in the double drum, this a Kel-Tec
Marco been in prison for a while, but he still flex
You might also like[Verse 2]
I told brodie 'nem to park the car, but they still wrecked
I don't think nobody around steal, but I still check
I don't got a hundred mil' yet, I can't chill yet
But don't get it misconstrued, yeah, I get real checks
Baby fuckin' like a pornstar, we have real sex
Have nobody in our business, we take Learjets
Say she like when I perform, so I fuck her with my chains on
And she handlin' her part, so I let her play the main role
Ain't have to get rich for these partners, still with the same folks
And I can't beef with none of you niggas, not in the same boat
I'm never gon' get caught up about it, know how the game go
Tennis chain bustin', look like rainbows

[Chorus]
I'm like, ""Come and put that pussy on me, don't be runnin' from me""
If I like it, I spend money on it, get whatever from me
Put six figures in your business, I do real shit
I drop cash at the dealership, they'll mail you a pink slip
She make sure she keep her nails did and her wig fixed
Went to jail and that one held me down, she a real bitch
Hundred rounds in the double drum, this a Kel-Tec
Marco been in prison for a while, but he still flex

I'm on an island, even when you're close
Can't take the silence, I'd rather be alone

[Pre-Chorus]
I think it's pretty plain and simple, we gave it all we could
It's time I wave goodbye from the window
Let's end this like we should and say we're good

[Chorus]
We're not meant to be, like sleeping and cocaine
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself
Let's end it like we should and say we're good

No need to hide it, go get what you want
This won't be a burden if we both don't hold a grudge

2021,Gone,Dierks Bentley,"[Verse 1]
My buddies think I'm on the lake
Boss thinks I've been sick for days
And mama's probably on her way
'Cause I ain't picked up the phone

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been a million places
But they're all up in my head
Over-drinking, overthinking ever since you left

[Chorus]
I've been gone, I've been gone
I've been sittin' on the couch watching TV all day long
All day long, I've been tryin' to figure out how a good thing went wrong
Faster than that freight train, farther than that airplane
Sadder than a country song
Headed down that highway, anywhere but my way
Ever since you moved on, I've been gone

[Verse 2]
Took a trip down memory lane
Checked into hotel heartbreak
Passed rock bottom on the way
Without leaving my living room

2021,Almost Maybes,Jordan Davis,"[Verse 1]
I had one saying we were done
In a Baton Rouge college bar
It kinda came out of nowhere
Man, I took that one pretty hard (That one pretty hard)
And I had another one in another town
And I spent a whole lot of nights missing her
'Til it all went black, she stopped texting back
And I finally got the picture

[Chorus]
So here's to the almost, so close
It's over out of the blues
Here's to the ""hey, I think we need to talk""
And the ""it ain't me, it's you"" (Oh, it ain't me)
Here's to the tears and beers and wasted years
On the weeds that looked like daisies
I wouldn't be sitting here next to you
If it weren't for the almost maybes

[Verse 2]
Here's to the one that my family thought
Was gonna make me drop to one knee
And I tried like hell, but I couldn't help
My mama loved her more than me (Mama loved her more than me)
And to all those July crushes
Turning into September leavin's
Goodbyes that didn't feel good back then
It happened for a real good reason

Am I settlin' up or settlin' down?

2021,Build A Bitch,Bella Poarch,"[Chorus]
This ain't Build a Bitch (A bitch)
You don't get to pick and choose
Different ass and bigger boobs
If my eyes are brown or blue
This ain't Build a Bitch (A bitch)
I'm filled with flaws and attitude
So if you need perfect, I'm not built for you (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
Bob the Builder broke my heart
Told me I need fixing
Said that I'm just nuts and bolts
Lotta parts were missing
Curvy like a cursive font
Virgin and a vixen
That's the kind of girl he wants
But he forgot

Black Goku, slap these rap hopefuls
Snatch ya stacked vocal tracks off the Pro Tools
Lemme show you how a pro move
I could take a stroll in the middle of Chernobyl
I could put the whole damn game in a chokehold
Stunner to the dome, on the floor like I'm Stone Cold
Butter with the flows when I float on the ropes though
You don't really wanna be the target in my focal
Put a shell to ya back like a slowbro
Neo when I move, see the whole world in slo-mo
Killa with the tools, it ain't sweet when I reign bows
Bodies in thе morgue looking more like Janе Does
Know they fresh like them halos a day old
Drapeto never been a slave to a name on a payroll
Still they wanna play with the god, you ain't Kraytos
You the goat? Nah, scapegoat
Cut the head, feed it to a volcano
Swerving down the 95 South like J. Cole
I was in the cut so much, had to lay low
Couldn't get a cut, now I look like a young Hov
The rap basquiat, feel like I'm Pac with locs
Two shots in the dark when I pop a cop
Need despot on top like I'm Papa Doc
And I rock when I drop, they just talk a lot
So stop, watch how I move
Do it broad day like we strike at high noon
Family ties like crips and pyroos
Gotta be nice when I script a haiku
All my niggas sinners, never lift a bible, we tribal

2021,Sun Goes Down,Lil Nas X,"[Chorus]
I wanna run away
Don't wanna lie, I don't want a life
Send me a gun and I'll see the sun
I'd rather run away
Don't wanna lie, I don't want a life
Send me a gun and I'll see the sun

[Post-Chorus]
You need an instant ease
From your life where you got plenty
Of every hurt and heartbreak (Oh)
You just take it all to the face
I know that you want to cry
But there's much more to life than dyin'
Over your past mistakes (Oh)
And people who threw dirt on your name

[Verse]
Since ten, I been feelin' lonely
Had friends, but they was pickin' on me
Always thinkin', ""Why my lips so big?
Was I too dark? Can they sense my fears?""
These gay thoughts would always haunt me
I prayed God would take it from me
It's hard for you when you're fightin'
And nobody knows it when you're silent
I'd be by the phone
Stanning Nicki mornin' into dawn
Only place I felt like I belonged
Strangers make you feel so loved, you know?
And I'm happy by the way
That I made that jump, that leap of faith
I'm happy that it all worked out for me
I'ma make my fans so proud of me, oh
You might also like[Chorus]
I wanna run away

[Post-Chorus]
You need an instant ease
From your life where you got plenty
Of every hurt and heartbreak (Oh)
You just take it all to the face
I know that you want to cry
But there's much more to life than dying
Over your past mistakes (Oh)

2021,4 Da Gang,42 Dugg & Roddy Ricch,"[Intro: Scorpions with 42 Dugg]
You
I can't wait for the nights with you
I imagine the things we'll do

[Verse 1: 42 Dugg & Scorpions]
Ain't nothin' plain on me, nigga, four chains on me (I just want to be loved by you)
I ain't trippin' 'bout that ho, nigga, she came on me
I got a bitch from the West, she'll suck a nigga soft
Bitch from the East, she'll fuck a nigga dawgs (No one like—)
Still playin' with that raw even though I got a deal
Had to get up out the city, I just got a nigga killed
Pause, I'm lyin', kinda, still sippin' out the Fanta
OxyContin and Opanas, I want four-two for each
Niggas upped Lou for free, that's my nigga, come and kick it
Mister still'll serve the city, I'm the reason it's some chicken
Why the fuck you in the kitchen tryna turn one?
Daire quit pullin' on thе blender 'fore you burn somе
Baby say she want a real nigga, but she don't get it
Why you ain't never up at night? I told you I been sippin'
Still go harder for my niggas, wish I could bring you back
Turntest in the city, white lows, blue flags
Know I keep two flags on bang
I just dropped a Urus for the gang
Catch me in the city, young nigga, four chains
Signed to CMG, still in the dope game
I don't swipe propane, really got it out the mud
Big 4 Gang, catch me ridin' with the thugs
And I got it on my own, ain't nobody helped me
Remain humble, sell crack to dope fiends
You can't ""Lil' bro"" me, bitch, I really got a check
42 in this shit, I be really on that
Put the city on my back, still remember hard times
2018 was the year my dawg died

Know I keep two flags on bang
I just dropped a Urus for the gang
Tied from the D to LA
Always keep it a hunnid K

[Verse 2: Roddy Ricch]
Number one nigga, but they're never gon' admit it
I was doin' two-hundred in the 'Rari and got a ticket
Every time they see me, they say they ain't seen me in a minute
Probably fuckin' on your bitches, probably runnin' up the digits
Forgiato wheels, both lanes
Floor mats say a nigga name
Interrogation, feds tried to put us on the board, never identified
All my niggas always gettin' dough, it's always chicken time
I got niggas in the box, gon' call me collect
I got model bitches that be tryna call me for sex
And you know what they say, ""If it ain't directed, then don't respect it""
You see 'em out in public, they gon' act like they never said it
I see by the C-side, I throw it up two times
And your nigga got a gangster card, he bought it off Groupon
One of the young niggas that be gettin' love in the city
From the hub to the dub in the tub, fuck with me
[Chorus: 42 Dugg & Roddy Ricch]
Pull up in frog eyes, yeah nigga, we winning

2021,Minimum Wage,Blake Shelton,"[Verse 1]
Yeah, I met you 'fore anyone knew my name
Playin' for pennies on the dive bar stage
Split an all-star special on our first date
In a Waffle House booth
Your daddy was cryin' when he gave you away
'Cause all those country songs I played
They didn't come with a 401k
But hey, I had you

[Chorus]
You can make a six-pack on the carpet
Taste like a million-dollar bill
You can make a one-bedroom apartment
Feel like a house up on the hill
You can make my truck out in the driveway
Roll like a cleaned up Cadillac
Girl, lookin' at you lookin' at me that way
Can make a man feel rich on minimum wage

2021,interlude,J. Cole,"[Intro]
Right, right, right, right
Something's got a hold on me
Right, right, right, right
Sometimes I think pain is just a lack of understanding
If we could only understand it all, would we feel no pain?
God must feel no pain
Something's got a hold on me
Only joy
Does this mean even our suffering pleases him?

[Verse]
Lost in a cloud of marijuana
Young Carolina nigga, fish out of water
Step-daddy just had a daughter with another woman
Mama ain't recover yet
Callin' me at 12 at night
She drunk as fuck and I'm upset
'Cause why she always using me for crutch?
Growin' up I used to always see her up
Late as shit, cigarette smoke and greatest hits from Marvin Gaye
She kill a whole bottle of some cheap chardonnay
I gotta leave this house 'cause part of me dies when I see her like this
Too young to deal with pain
I'd rather run the streets than see her kill herself
So 'Ville became my escape from a feelin' I hate
Mama cursing me out
Depression's such a villainous state
I used to stay out later on purpose
Subconsciously I was nervous that if I came home early then what would surface was her inner demons
And then I'd have to end up seein' my hero on ground zero
Tears flow while Al Green blow
Love and happiness
I wish that I could say the right words to cheer her up
I wish her son's love was enough
I tell her, ""Mama, go to sleep""
She tell me ""Boy, hush. You better pray to God you never get your heart crushed""
I shake my head in frustration
Head to my room and I can still hear the tunes with my door shut
Fuck it though, a couple more months I'll be gone
Off to college and dorms
Foolin' myself, thinkin' problems are gone
But now it's 1 AM and my mama dialin' my phone
I know she intoxicated and soon this high that I'm on comes crashin' down
She lit, talkin' drunk shit, I'm pissed
But I'm still all ears like Basset Hounds
Thinkin' to myself, ""Maybe my mama need help
Don't she got work in the morning?
Why she do this to herself?
Hate how she slurrin' her words
Soundin' so fuckin' absurd
This ain't the woman I know, why I just sit and observe?
Why don't I say how I feel?
When I do, she's defensive for real
Well maybe things get better with time, I heard it heals
Little did I know how deep her sadness would go
Lookin' back, I wish I woulda did more instead of runnin'

New tape soon D&W shit you already know

[Chorus]
Whole label up man the pack winning
Swag down to my jeans yeah Raf Simons
Don't hit my DM 'less we talkin' business
Everyday stack money like its Christmas

[Verse]
Stacks up I just got a bankroll
Bitch, I don't hang with no snakes, always stay cold
Always in the stu' applying pressure, bitch, J. Cole
IG model in my bed, eating out her cake though
Sad as fuck all the time, I miss my old friends
Up town, 311, riding in a new Benz
Man this shit a breeze, I don't stress hard
Shoutout Xeno got blue hunnids cuz I flex hard
Money on my mind just like a migraine
Always skipping class I ain't have no high grade
Love songs make me sad I don't got nobody
Evеryone I fuck with treat me likе I'm nobody
Choppa make it dance goin viral
Go and mind your damn business, I ain't your idol
Hardest in the game, tryna claim the title
I stay winnin' and my haters suicidal
Think you got jokes, you ain't Hivemind
Stoner Patch Kids, I got a high mind (boo)
That bar was ass but Imma bounce back
Knew that ass was real when it bou- my fault
Tryna keep my group clean, I don't fuck with cornballs
Go 'head and stay made, I'm tryna get the score off (aren't you something)
Got a bag, but I'm tryna stack more bread
Stalking the IG Live, watch the money spread
Tryna get my shit together, now I'm 18
I'll show you a few things, feel like JT
Top of the game, everyone love me

All the love you's and the hate you's and the secrets that you told me
Here's to everyone but mostly us

There's a couple billion people in the world

Caught up in a moment like it's just us in this room
All the right words at the right time
And you know 'em 'cause you know me better than anyone else
We don't need anyone else

There's a couple billion people in the world (Yeah-yeah-yeah)

2021,Blame It On You,Jason Aldean,"[Verse 1]
Goin' down like a sunset
Burnin' out like a cigarette
Blowin' through the cash, through the past
Drinking down that memory 'til there's nothin' left

[Pre-Chorus]
I could go on and on
Why you're gone

[Chorus]
I could blame it on the whiskey
I wouldn't blame you if you didn't even miss me
Gave you a million reasons, girl, not to be with me
Should've never let you go
Should've never watched you go
I could blame it on a good high
Let it take the blame for why you told me goodbye
Instead of missin' you and missin' all those good times
Should've never let you go
Should've never watched you go

[Post-Chorus]
I could say I never knew
I could drink around the truth
But I can't blame it on you (Do you still think about me too?)
Yeah, yeah (Baby, do you still think about me too?)

2021,Quicksand,Morray,"[Intro]
Hmm, yeah
Hmm, yeah
Hmm, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Since a jit stood tall with a kickstand
Thinking of a plan to get quick bands
Falling in deep with the quicksand
Flag out my ass, no quick brand
I was packing on the pounds, got my weight up
Had beef on the streets, had to stay up
Betty Crocker showed me how to bake a cake, bruh
Doing that put everything I love at stake, bruh
Since a jit stood tall with a kickstand
Thinking of a plan to get quick bands
Falling in deep with the quicksand
Flag out my ass, no quick brand
I was packing on the pounds, got my weight up
Had beef on the streets, had to stay up
Betty Crocker showed me how to bake a cake, bruh
Doing that put everything I love at stake, bruh

[Verse 1]
Back in the day, man a nigga had rip jeans
Couldn't afford a new pair, I had broke seams
Couldn't think about the money, I had broke dreams
Outfit was the match of a crack fiend
I was tryna be fly, I couldn't take off
Clothes falling off my ass, lost weight, dawg
No jacket in the winter, had the shakes, dawg
Then I said, ""Fuck it,"" 'cause something gone have to shake, dawg
Then my nigga Bobby put me on a quick lick
Wasn't a lot but enough for a quick fix
Interceptions, I was stealing, caught me a pick six
In the snow pitching woe, bitch it was brick dick
Never killed, ain't gone lie, I was tempted
He was the target, but he lucky that I missed it
I was always fucking up, was a misfit
My opportunity was knocking and I missed it
Young when I hopped off the stoop
Two doors what I floor if I hop in the coupe
Too sore from a war where I couldn't lose
Got scars and bruises, man, I got the proof
Resemble young Steele 'cause I got the juice
You think you 2Pac, let Omar Epps loose
Stepping on necks with my Timberland boots
I'm planted, I'm stable, I'm growing in roots, yeah

[Verse 2]
I remember chillin' at one of my little bitch crib
'Bout to fuck, 'bout to nut, main course with the fixings
Her nigga came through, he was all on some bitch shit
Didn't know I was raw and my hands was so gifted
Boy had me chop, had get him a mix quick
Couple knots made him drop like he drunk or he lifted
Fought another nigga after I thought was some kinship
Throwing up both of our sets which ended the friendship
Gave respect neck to neck, my nigga didn't back down
Had 'em standing up then he ended up back down
His hands in my life now they ended up flat now
Flat like a wing, let's see if he flap now
Had enough, it was tough only lasted about one round
K.D. on the bench equipped with the tre pound
Made 'em run, it was funny, he was scared of the gun sound
Made 'em shit, he a bitch, by the car he was ducked down
I ain't got no time for the fakes
The phonies, jabronies, the ops or the Jakes
My homies the only who come past the gate
I'm whacking the weeds, cutting heads off of snakes
I'm hungry, I'm eating right off of ya plate
I want it, I'm on it, it's mine for the take
I'm stagnant, a magnet, I'm staying in place
The reason I'm popping is all of the hate, yeah

2021,Single Saturday Night,Cole Swindell,"[Verse 1]
I was out taking shots
Throwing down at the spot
Three sheets, just me and the guys
Every single Saturday night
I was killing time, crushing cans
Trying not to catch a tan
'Cause I was under them neon lights
Every single Saturday night, yeah
Everybody knew they could find me there
And right out of the blue, right out of nowhere
Out of nowhere

[Chorus]
Sittin’ over in the corner, baby, I saw
Pretty red lips, working on a White Claw
Shakin' to a little “Shook Me All Night Long”
And I thought, ""Man, what a beautiful sight""
Ain't a mornin’ you don't wake up in my shirt now
Even holding hands walkin' out of church now
Who'd of thought, baby, looking back that
That would be my last single Saturday night?
Yeah
My last single Saturday night

[Verse 2]
And now when I'm out, havin' a drink or two
If they see me, huh, they see you
'Cause, girl, I got you by my side
Every single Saturday night, yeah
Every now and then, the boys tell me they miss me
Oh but they all get it 'cause they were right there with me
Yeah with me, when

I wasn't looking for love when I walked through the door
But damn if I didn't find what I wasn't even looking for

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Sittin' over in the corner, baby, I saw
Pretty red lips, working on a White Claw
Shakin' to a little “Shook Me All Night Long”
And I thought, ""Man, what a beautiful sight""
Ain't a morning you don't wake up in my shirt now
Look at us even pickin' out a church now
Who'd of thought, baby, looking back that
That would be my last single Saturday night?

[Verse 1]
Baby, we tried to fight it
We all been there some days
Thought I needed something else
And acted like I was okay
We just had to work it out
And baby, I needed space
Ain't nobody 'round here on your level
You're so far away
You're pouring your heart out
I'm acting like I knew
You held me so down
So down I never grew, oh
I tried to find out
When none of them came through
And now I'm stuck in the middle
And baby had to pull me out, oh

Damn papa, you a rare breed, no comparing
And it's motherfuckin' scary
Tryna keep him 'cause I found him
Let a ho know I ain't motherfuckin' sharing
I could take you to the parents, then to Paris
Plan a motherfuckin' wedding
You the type I wanna marry (Yeah) and keep you merry
I'll put the ring on when you ready
We play our fantasies out in real life ways and
No Final Fantasy, can we end these games though?
You give me energy, make me feel lightweight (Woo)
Like the birds of a feather, baby (Woo)
We real life made for each other (Woo)
And it's hard to keep my cool
When other bitches tryna get with my dude and
When other chickens tryna get in my coop
'Cause you're a one in a million
There ain't no man like you

2021,100.mil',J. Cole & Bas,"[Round 1: Arsonal]
Nigga suck my dick!
In the most disrespectful way I can spit it to you
All that shit you say you wishin' a nigga would do, niggas did it to you
I'll leave a hole big enough to fit a midget through
I'ma introduce the world to a clown
And I don't need help from Steven King to present It to you
Steven King Presents It, oh it's a different vibe
All that Champion Of The Year money, this clown ass nigga still don't know how to use his penny wise (Pennywise)
But when me and Jimmie rock, Suge the shooter and driver, watch how the Hemi slide
Shotgun out the window in Compton, the same alley where Ricky died
Oh nah that was South Central
So I let a round hit you from a loud pistol
When I could quietly stab you in the navel and just drag what's in the south, central
Out in Compton, I'll roll in ya neighborhood, hippie vibes
Six shooter, old man revolver, but I give a 60, five
Oh but you Nutty Blocc, you Compton Crip, my mistake then
You still bang the Six God, you'll get beat wit' a .40 ain't talkin' Drake friend
Ain't no beast to unleash you just be caged in
How I'ma believe the bars your pen state when it took you this long to get past the bars in the state pen'?
But you Nutty Blocc, Compton Crip, big C's you throwin' 'round
'Til you assigned a wheelchair for the rest of ya life, pussy  you Rolling now
I'll grab ya bitch head, while she bobbin' for apples and push her nose in now
Why? Cause I promised Gotti if he went back to jail I would hold you down
Oh but you big Crip? But you give me no option
How I'm supposed to believe your set run the west when half the world includin' the neutral niggas refer to yo' city as ""Bompton""
Let a nigga say they from ""Bewark, New Jersey""
Nigga that semi go choppin'
Smack, Chico, Beasley, Avoca- ain't no fuckin' video's droppin'
I make a movie wit' the toaster, shotgun in the armpit
Kick back gon' make me do the Lil' Uzi wit' the shoulder straps
I would've brought a TEC wit' a 100 clip just so I could give him a Hot 97
And niggas wonder why I Flex
I'm from a city where mothers die for sets
I really live what's in my notebook pussy, my life a Butterfly Effect
I said, nigga don't talk that street shit to the concrete
Cause I laid the foundation and paved the way for you Prodigy's to be able to cause Havoc and even Mobb Deep
Nigga my .9 speak
I pull up on Gotti at five guys, we nine deep
Hmm, now I beat y'all all of this hair on his side burns; Ashanti
I'll get this dummy shot, both arms up, I'm doin' the Mummy Bop
My whole avenue retarded, ""Me, I'm really from Nutty Blocc""
Now if we heard Gotti shootin', what he playin'? Prolly 2K
For nigga keep goin' back to jail on purpose, what that mean to y'all? Prolly he gay
Ya mother said you can be anything you put ya mind to, right? And she proud of you, hey
Well I could give a fuck what ya ma-ma-mama said bitch, you ain't Bobby Boucher
So don't talk to me like I'm stupid, cause your Tommy unemployed
Bitch I ain't Cole
Stab wound through his chest, then push the bullet through the same hole
I never went down, cause I never got caught, my niggas ain't told
Why? Cause I do my shit all by my lonely like I'm J. Cole
I don't wanna know what ya life like
Or what ya stain in ya hood and what your stripes like
Just know that I got triple what they paid you, plus PayPerView, so what's your price like?
Kimbo Slice, Miami backyard, I'm tryin' to fight fight
Kevin Hart told me Gotti the nigga tryin' to go night night
Now I tried to show you that there's a better you nigga
A side of you that you never knew
I'ma show you how involving yourself in the beef will turn you to a vegetable
Nigga you ever have real fiends beggin' you for the residue?
I'm from a city where niggas will literally chop ya neck off ya shoulder just to say they got ahead of you
You talkin' like you play wit' birds?
Nigga, ya dead homies got what they deserved
I came to Compton just to spit in ya mother mouth and smoke my favorite herb
Now you in front of the judge and you don't play with verbs
Stupid nigga got convicted for everything he was up against
Y'all tryin' to convince me that he got a way with words
Man my shit is real and you can see it in my eyes
Suck my dick! And let these people believe them lies
Nigga time!
You might also like[Round 1: Geechi Gotti]
Nigga that shit was fire!
For real, he was spittin' some retarded shit
Up here dressed like a 'How To Be A Crip' starter kit
Nigga you'se a bitch!
Do somethin', I'll really shoot somethin'
Cross my line, and I'll shut the Volume down like a mute button
Nigga you stuntin'
I liked you better back in them Grind Time mode
But this the URL, this my shit now
And ever since I been the Champ, all these niggas want smoke
I don't see no lies told
Ask Smack
Soon as these niggas come to the crib, I'm the first thing they ask about like the wi-fi code
Nigga y'all like hoes, be in ya inner circle's whisperin' 'bout me
'Til you meet me and realize you just a 300 and I'm a Bentley
Breakfast Club ass niggas, y'all see (C) Da God and envy
You be on D shit, shout out to them Damu's
Y'all know how we do
My real niggas know if I holla ""Asante""
“Background”: ketu
See now if he knew, he would've hollered out ketu
But see that's why I got a question Crippin', this a lesson given
You need to figure out if gang bangin' was yo' best decision
See the west is listenin'
Just like we supposed to, cause you from New Jersey and Grape Street
So do you got a problem with the east coast too?
Cause Grape Street beef wit' the east coast, but you from the east coast
Ain't that like a conflict of interest?
I guess what's happenin' in Watts ain't none of y'all niggas business
Y'all niggas bitches, you a hoe Ars'
Gotti let the fo' spark
Catch him in his whip, I'll turn that bitch to a go kart
Headshot, need the locks on the do'; I'm Joe Clark
You don't want no part
I already bodied Suge, now Arsonal comin' straight for a vengeance
It ain't jelly when I say I got some artificial Grapes on my biscuits
Y'all be my witness
I'ma need two caskets, Red can get it too since you yappin'
But his apple in a box with the Grapes, it's a fruit basket
Nigga I'm spazzin', Gotti got the juice now
Mix Red's blood on top of Grapes and make it Fruit Town
Nigga you clowns, I'm a real nigga, that shit ain't on me, bitch the shit in me
Gun under the chin, leave a hole that exit out the top, that shit a chimney
It offend me, when you be actin' like you from them JD projects, but ain't put on none of them niggas
But you on the rap game makin' money for one of JD's projects
But I guess, I'll let the .40 bank heads, that's if he outta line
Lemon squeeze in his face, it's our (sour) time
The bottom line, I got a lot of ways I can murder him
If I'm choosing where to shoot, I'ma pick his locks like a burglary
The nerve of me, I'm back on that dumb shit
Hand gun with the drum clip, I'm dumpin' the .40, I want a young bitch
Nigga, one hit, will have his mind gone, he brain dead
Now a machine help him with his words like Rhymezone
Nigga we in different time zones
I'm on that Pacific time, grippin' mine
If this don't work, Twork voice, I got a bigga .9
This a crime
I was in jail when my patna got shot, DOA
I'm talkin' he didn't get away to the doctor
I came home to put in work for him, feelin' just like Meek in a helicopter
Cause I got out and went straight to a chopper
You in the face of a mobster!
I'll have every nigga here stretch him
Pistol whip, blunt force to the face, this peer pressure
These niggas talkin', well I'ma keep on talkin'
Nina sparkin', I've been on so many missions, bitch I'm tired of guns, I got heat exhaustion
This nigga's a fuckin' bus driver
Rappin' gangsta shit
I don't believe the nonsense, I'll show up to your job and pop on campus, it's a parent teacher conference
Nigga we believe in violence
I'll catch ya bitch and let the lead pop
All I heard was ""ooh"" ""ah"" ""eh"" before the headshot
The same bitch with different Screams; Sidney Prescott
The TEC's cocked, I get ya granny goin' to bed, put the silencer on it so the sound gone
If I let it spray, think ""graduation day"", that old bitch gettin' caped wit' her gown on
You a clown bro, Shoebox saved you in Detroit, that's the only reason you around us bro
I came from shootouts, bustin' 'til there ain't shit comin' out this hoe
I'm sayin', we both been saved by the Cal' befo'
And when it's-
Y'all can tell, you can see it in they eyes
Go 'head make niggas believe them lies
Nigga time
[Round 2: Arsonal]
Nigga suck my dick! For the second time
And now I said it to your face Crip
This like workplace harassment
I violate all your personal space bitch
I'm that cousin always on punishment, I'm not the nigga you can play wit'
So what I'm from the east nigga, gang bangin' is gang bangin', we on the same shit
I ain't new to this, I've been bangin' half my life, you must be misinformed
Oh I get it, I hardly, it hardly rain in southern California so you think we weather a different storm
Y'all know why me and this Ray Swag in the face ass nigga ain't never gon' get along?
Because you'd rather go to jail than break yo' mama heart showin' you tough, provin' some other niggas wrong
You still tryin' to prove you tough when you ride wit' yo' city
You said it yo'self you in the Grandee's 24/7 nigga
So when you gonna spend some time wit' yo' kids?
Yo youngest son really miss his daddy
And yo' patna teachin' him how to hold a gun
It's funny you spent more time in jail with yo' bunkie, but didn't spend that much time outside wit' yo' oldest son
See, who don't spend time wit' they kids, I don't support those
It's my job to fire, and leave you dead in your ""showin' up to court clothes.""
Niggas who think they Nutty on my Blocc, I extort those
All you hear is a loud BANG, remind you of how that county cell door close
Gettin' locked up is easy nigga
I can do some shit right now that's gon' land me in jail
Why is it so hard for you niggas to realize bein' absent from your kids life will leave them damaged as well?
You out here glorifyin' incarceration, this nigga scared to get mail
Nigga I give you five years tops 'til you and your oldest son together sharin' a cell
Nigga what?!
You think that jail shit scare me now?
Naw, what's scary is bein' the only nigga free in yo' hood and you gotta take care of all of yo' homies' families now
I'm on the phone with my nigga that's never comin' home
Tellin' him I just let his granny down
Nigga I come to Cali just to walk on yo' grass pussy, you Stanley now
Nigga you gon' meet karma
My hands speak fast and my reach longer
I never went to prison and I stayed free, so who really been on these streets longer?
Oh, oh oh, I'll slap this bitch, now it's gettin' domestic
You standin' there wit' yo' head down and yo' hands behind yo' back
You that used to gettin' arrested?
All that time you spent away from your two boys? I blame the game for it
But God already made him pay for it
They gave him life in the insane asylum, and they assigned him to the A. Ward
I'ma be straight forward, I'ma son of a gun, my mama was ratchet
But she told me, ""Never speak about ya pops.""
I ain't never tell on a soul, nothin' to speak about the cops
You got one style of rap nigga, you don't speak about a lot
But I get it, you wrote all your bars in prison you don't really know how to think outside the box
Nigga ya whole life was tied to the system
Stupid, you always guilty, DUH
That's why you rhyme with conviction
You look the part so ya lines in convincin'
Low cut, fucked up teeth Crip
Nigga you match beyond the description
And the nigga on Youtube, he got- he- he like, ""Yo, welcome to my hood. This the trap trap
The building over there on 165 and 166, oh that's where they make the packs at
Oh yeah that alley over there when the cops run down it's where we throw the straps at.""
Dispatch on the other line like, ""10-4 did you catch that?""
He ain't done he still goin', he said, ""Yo aye cuz, this wall right here cuz, it's full of dead homies I wish I could bring back to life
Lil' Half A Slice, on Nutty man he was a killer. He lived the savage life.""
He said, ""Aye cuz, what he'd kill, 'bout ten niggas before he made the sacrifice?""
Nigga you tellin' everything, you out here gettin' niggas indited in the after-life
Ya name ""Bay Loc""
You a fat Derrick Rose, man you gon' stay broke
And a victim of the system
No anesthesia through this incision, we need you to stay woke
Nigga, I'm here to snatch every bit of saliva out ya bae throat
Hit once then make the bitch disappear like she Def Loaf
Now between me and Gotti, it's a distance
You from where gang bangin' originated, so why I'm
{Stream cuts out}

Between me and Gotti it's a distance
Cause you went from where gang bangin' originated, but I'm more world wide known for this Crippin'
I'm Crip, you gon' be disabled there's a difference
Your bitch gotta take my dick twice a day after she eat, my shit prescription
Some shit'll never change, I'm super Crip
In my car I got the handicap sign up and everythang
That mean I get to park closer to ya job givin' me the aim
Dessy rang, I'm hittin' innocent by-standards,  I ain't got deadly aim
So I cut him in slow-mo
Word to Dobo, I put that on everythang
I go berserk on him
Bury his body I throw the dirt on him
I set him up, I had my unemployed bitch throw the work on him
Catch ya spirit headed to the afterlife, I throw the scope on him
But I ain't pull the trigger, old fashioned ass whoopin'
Beat him wit' the stick until it broke on him
He a rat, I put the cheese on his head like he from Green Bay
You the man? Well not 'round here, nigga Dikembe
Boy, the way I do you with this fourth and inches, just watch the replay
I'ma keep on cuttin' him and bringin' him back like I was a DJ
I'll put the muzzle on it, then I aim .9
What that mean? I kill him and give that moment of silence at the same time
As long as he get hospitalized tonight, I'll remain calm
Cause honestly, Gotti he could Die Another Day word to James Bond
My shit is real, you can see it in my eyes
Suck my dick and let these niggas believe yo' lies
Nigga time!

[Round 2: Geechi Gotti]
All these, behind bars bars, was the type of shit you had niggas laughin' 'bout
I find it funny, how you could condemn me cause I'm goin' to jail for the shit you be rappin' 'bout
I got you niggas bangin' again
If y'all wasn't doin' it then, nigga don't be doin' it now
Tryin' to show me you gangsta, only make me think you niggas clowns
Even the vets, talk all that shit about the PG process
Then get on the card with me and all of a sudden it's the Proving Grounds
Nigga, you'se a clown
You was a Blood I heard that turned Grape Street
That's some weird shit
I knew he was a fag, cause only queers switch
Nigga real shit, you a bitch in the streets but you wanna be a Crip in the ring
Arm to his chest, look like his shit in a sling
This bitch wit' a beam
I'll steam his face, nigga I'll kill ya kid, now you a seedless Grape
Ain't no need to hate nigga, y'all straight bitches
The only battle rappers from Grape Street, is Aktive and Dre Vishiss
Tryin' to act like Grape a hood that you love
You givin' him three up top but you never booked him on UDubb!
Nigga, I'm disrespectful just like cuz, except the bars heavy
I'll kidnap ya daughter, you find her Trapped In The Closet wit' R. Kelly
Yeah I'm disrespectful, you ain't gon' do a damn thang 'bout it
I'll kill that lil' bitch, show up to her funeral, get her obituary, make a paper plane out it
Yo' little girl, that's ya world? You better keep her out my way aight
I usually don't hit kids, but today I might
Choke her, 'til you got a Blueface baby, 'Yeah Aight'
You goddamn right, I'll put the blade to his daughter's scalp
Make sure that lil' bitch in pain
How the fuck y'all callin' Arsonal ""Da Rebel"" but I'm the one goin' against the grain
This shit insane
Ya baby mama look good, ooh them tits soft
After I fuck her I use his daughter clothes to wipe my dick off
I'm disrespectful, I'm tryin' to figure him out
I hope on them field trips they say, ""This dude nuts""
I hope on them field trips you catch yo' daughter givin' head on the back of ya school bus
This dude nuts
I been tryin' to figure him out
I seen his daughter, I said ""You would never succeed (suck seed) until somebody bust they kids in ya mouth!""
Look what he did for the clout!
He been rappin' like that 15+
I can't remember a time he was lyrical
The King Of Disrespect? He ain't got enough respect for the craft to write fire material
I'm tired of hearin' you
I don't even think you no real nigga, I can tell by yo' demeanor
You became a bus driver cause you ain't have the smarts to be a teacher
Nigga you a leecher
Ride every nigga wave that you close to
Scream Fetty Wap name all last year, he ain't even post you
You a weirdo
Portrayed to be a Loc by your peers though
I know ya fears bro
You wear that purple flag so in Cali you got a spot for protection
But tell these niggas how when you in Cali you scared to even go to ya section
Nigga look in the mirror
I be he see a hoe in the reflection
I'm talkin' real shit, ain't nothin' outta context
If he wasn't a rapper, he wouldn't have even stepped foot in them projects
But I guess, he better be glad he can rap
Cause you ain't no shooter from them Bricks, that's an actual fact
But since you can rap and you bangin' they shit puttin' 'em on
They let him do it, they just gotta tax you for that
It's tax season! The whole projects claimin' him as a dependent
Payin' grown men for protection, that gotta be weird
Tell Suge he should be cool showin' up now, they show love to big bitches 'round this time of the year
We not the same!
I really had to put in work for my name
True story, I done really put niggas on shirts for the game
This nigga made a game; Arsonal's Revenge
(Aye, for real they gon' buy that shit)
Arsonal's Revenge, aye but that don't mean he 'bout his business or his wealth
It's just like I been tellin' y'all
He good at creatin' an image for himself
Yeah you bang Grape Street but in Watts you be scared faggot, I know ya story
Can't show up to the projects without a care package
Every time he come over there, shit be feelin' like Christmas
Got him givin' out money and free Fetty Wap tickets
How he talkin' Grape Street like he really wit' that
If he was, how come when Suge got robbed he ain't get his shit back?
Grape Street that nigga, Grape Street this
Them niggas took ya phone and ya motherfuckin' jewelry, you ain't been back on Grape Street since
He had trouble wit' that
Brand new .50, I can't even feel the kickback
This a clean cal', you can tell by the Gun Title it got a Double Impact
Nigga if you ain't shootin' shit, you can't even talk to Gotti
I'm a walkin' homi
Nigga believe none of what you hear and only half of what you see
They prolly don't even understand what I'm talkin' prolly
Cause the news said I dropped a nigga, that was a lie
I caught the body!
And when it's real, y'all tell
(You can see it in they eyes
Go head, it's yo' turn, make them nigga believe them lies
Nigga time)

[Round 3: Arsonal]
Nigga suck my dick! Third times a charm
I thought you would've swung by now
This nigga ain't got no fight left in him, he like, ""He already won by now.""
I admire you knowin' you couldn't beat me but him still try
But you popped up at the wrong time, that's an in-field fly
Meaning ya hitter out immediately
Ya runners? Lookin' hesitant
12, 13, 14 letters of the alphabet, Gotti you way outta ya element
Get ya bars up, I don't get stuck in the moment, I'll leave a star struck
Serve him through the window early morn', ""Welcome to Starbucks""
Gun spark, light flash, you think a photo man behind ya
No! Tommy in his face barkin' in his face like, ""I don't know no damn Kiana.""
I'ma be real wit' niggas
Smack and Beasley, they tryin' to build a nigga
Code word: Salt Bae
They fly me in to give a meal (mil') to niggas
Telekinesis powers when I'm mad, I Matilda niggas
I got still for niggas, meet my New Edition, I'm Johnny Gill wit' niggas
BOOM! Through ya front door, knock ya bitch up, then pick her up
Put the deuce to his head like I was tryin' to fuck the picture up
Show up to the funeral, reach in the casket and grab ya sister butt
Cause my first name ""I Don't"", last name ""Give A Fuck""
AKA Durrell ""Disrespectful"" Jones
I'm not ya friend brother
I'll slap the dog shit outta you and ya friend mother
How many times you copped out at court? Let's not pretend brother
You would've been a house nigga, and I can tell by ya skin color
Nigga my tool is chunky, ya father fell in love with a foolish junkie
I stay ten toes down with my fuckin' chin up, I don't care who confront me
You a flunky and ya whole hood green
That's why ya son remind me of the lil' nigga H&M had referred to as the ""coolest monkey""
I wish I was the doctor standin' in-between ya bitch legs when she was givin' birth
Cause that would've solidified my spot as the one nigga who get to smack that lil' nigga first
Yeah, umbilical cord wrapped around his neck
You want a birth death?
I almost kill him on purpose just to say him and watch him struggle through his first breaths
Soon as the nigga 'bout to walk, I clip him before he take his first steps
Him and his other brother, they competin' who gon' have the worst death
Rebel shit
This level of success, you will never get
Special Olympics, I'm here to show y'all who the better Crip
Grape Street, we the gang
Speak in vain, heaters bang
We Crippin' form a different point of view, we don't see the same
Nigga, to me you still a tiny Loc nigga
So take this L and let that L sit
You came in here lookin' for Ars' and got Durrell bitch
I'm quick to let a shell kick
For goin' against the grain, what I'm raising (raisin) will put a Nut' in the bag we makin' trail mix
But you don't even think like that
Last night in Le Palace you yellin', ""Anything possible"" and you don't even drink like that
I'll walk up in ya son's school
Go to the oldest lil' nigga class
Rex ad lib, yell ""That nigga dead!"" when he say he miss his dad
Man, in front of his classmates I'll fuckin' whip his ass
Man, and then walk downstairs and tell ya younger son, ""Go stand in the street in front of that hell cat.""
Then I did the dash
Y'all wanna know what happened next?
I hit his ass!
I knocked him so far back he flew into the Ghost Of Christmas Past
Last time the nigga seen his daddy, he had to kiss the glass
Next time gon' be to identify him and zip the bag
I said, my bitch toughened up
I ain't gotta shoot or do an uppercut
Code word: Orgasm
(What that mean?)
She was trained to squirt and bust a Nut'

[Girl in crowd]
Talk naaasty!

[Arsonal]
He said, she said, I don't care what niggas said 'bout him
One day he true blue, BAOW! Next mornin' niggas read (red) 'bout him
Baow! Baow! Baow! Another one blew (blue)
Blaow! And it knocked all of the red out him
Then you gon' see a Grape Street Crip moonwalkin' through the blood just to say I did it in red bottoms
Now if I pull up, it's gon' be Glocks involved
Mops and all, I'm lettin' rockets off
{Cell phone sound} Brrrrrrrt
The doctor makin' a Compton call
Surgery! Blottin' up his exit wounds with cotton balls
You just sell wigs, I get paid to knock 'em off!
I said, is we talkin' colors here? Or your profession and how you color hair?
I'll slap ya nephew in front of ya mother to see if ya brother care
Somebody please dare me to do it
(I dare you)
Do I hear a double dare?
My shit is real, my shit is raw my shit is authentic
Ya bitch mouth had my finger, dick and balls in it
She did it in front of ya house and didn't even give a fuck, cause the car tinted
We had a gang bang last night...she was involved in it
My shit is real, my shit is raw my shit is authentic
And you can't spell ""Bars"" without puttin' that ""Ars"" in it

[Smack]
Last round it's on-

[Arsonal]
Nah, sike I lied nigga
No, sike I lied nigga
Sike you died nigga
You made ten thousand dollars
Ten thou- man that's pocket change
You know what happened when they Dow jumped?
Man, let's just say I'm tied into the stock exchange
I mean, you said I was on tour, I was gettin' a lot of money with Fetty Wap and thangs
Where your Champion Of The Year money?
Cause I got a whole lot of gwap and thangs
You got Champion Of The Year money, why don't you put it to your ear dummy
This ""Trapion"" Of The Year money
Time nigga

[Round 3: Geechi Gotti]
Aye, y'all just seen that stack that this nigga pulled out?
That's a whole lot of money that he made from this art form
I hope after you die today, you give a little bit of that money to ya BM and ya daughter, that can be a nice lil' start for 'em
I mean you gotta give 'em somethin', cause I heard the stories
They said you barely for 'em
I'm just sayin', they bitches better pray they in ya will (wheel) like a car horn
Nitty already buried Suge
Now these niggas finna get a casket together
Said he ain't know Shotgun...they up here rappin' together
Y'all the fakest of friends
Headshot, when I say, ""The doc tryin' to patch things up"", he ain't makin' amends
Ain't no shakin' my hand
You do a whole lotta weak shit
In the field, the strap got no safety, we in goal line defense
They said ""Bro ain't got a weakness"" that's 'til the can' clap you
Hospital beds, rubber bands wrap you
His family like, ""How he doin'?""
I don't know, he just popped up on the 'tube, he a Banned battle
Nigga I'm from Nutty Blocc, this shit deeper than just a tattoo
You slapped the hat off Iron, I'll grab the iron and slap you!
That's a fact too, you a lil' boy to me Arsonal
Gave him the .9, the .40 and then the chopper
Just thought he needed a little more in him Arsonal (arsenal)
Fuck Arsonal though, cause if Ray Swag was here I would've shot him right in front of you
I would've gave him two in his brains
Niggas would've been yellin' for you to get ya dawg (dog) like he was loose from the chain
Nigga what you do for the game?
Niggas know I be in Compton with the Crips
AK's really poppin' and shit
Marshall Lawrence, the way we had to chop into bricks
Nigga I'm hittin' licks
A young nigga, makin' racks, I'm just statin' facts
The Feds was hot, I had to play the back
I'm just sayin', the pigs was all over ya dawg (dog), I was bakin' raps (bacon wraps)
Nigga face the facts
How you supposed to be a killer, but you ain't killed nothin' or drilled nothin'?
Walked in the house with blood on my shirt, told my mama I spilled somethin'
Steel dumpin', I'm still thuggin'
If they would've got the prints off the gun I wouldn't be here
You would've seen the kid do life
But I'm way too sharp like a Ginsu knife
Blue rag over the handle, that's a cloth over the grip like the lid too tight
Nigga you too light! I really came from shootouts
Check the score nigga, we up
On the missions, we just pray we make it back like the re-up
You see us, this what real Crippin' look like
You starin' at dope when it come back cooked right
I'm talkin' in the trap
Rare Breeds, we got it brick by brick
The smokers knew it was freebase like we got hit by pitch
Nigga this my shit
And these niggas be worryin' 'bout the wrong shit
Like if we should've stopped watchin' football cause of Kaepernick
Niggas die in my hood everyday, news just don't capture shit
Celebrities could talk about it, we just want 'em to do it
Crazy, while you was busy boycottin' the NFL my boy caught a bullet
I rep the gang to the fullest
I'm talkin' 'bout we shootin' 'til the lead gone
Tell the youth
""Ain't nothin' in this lifestyle but death. That's the truth.""
I be prayin' I was dead wrong
But where I'm from, when you be too hard headed, you end up a head stone
I'm from the streets, that's what they made sidewalks fo'
Niggas done really died on my block
Even standin' too close to the curb will get a nigga hit, we playin' sideline pop
Nigga I'm from the streets for real, they- aye ask about me in my hood
I was a young nigga, lettin' that lead fly shorty
I'm talkin' 16 fuckin' wit' a .40
Tell Lifetime I'm ready to tell my story
Survivin' the streets, if y'all would've seen what I seen, maaan, y'all prolly wouldn't have made it out
I'm tellin' you, this shit prolly would've made cuz quit
So many homies in the cemetery it's like they workin' graveyard shift
Nigga and I peep my nigga Knocca, sometimes I be wishin' I could go wit' him
So many niggas I done lost, I ain't got no mo' love in my heart
{Takes off his shoe}
Even my shoe ain't got a sole (soul) in 'em
Nigga every strap, got a pole in 'em
Two shots, that's why I clapped him
Another shot, body bagged him
Cause the third rounds just hit harder like when I be rappin'
It's a real life struggle everyday in the trenches
.40 goin' over my options, I'm tryin' to make a decision
Nigga Roc voice, ""It's me dawg.""
I'm from Nutty Blocc, hub in the dub, Watts
Nigga I show love to my Grape Street so free 03 and free Hogg
And when it's real y'all can tell, y'all can see it in they eyes
(Go 'head)
See if he can believe them lies

2021,Solid,Young Thug & Gunna Featuring Drake,"[Intro: Drake]
Ayy, slip, slide, tryna provide for me, for me, for me

[Chorus: Drake]
Find me somewhere out in London, you know that's the hideaway
I need some head and some moral support from you right away
Since I been makin' donations, see you like United Way (You know how I do)
Stories you told me 'bout him, I can see that it's night and day (He told me the truth)
Walkin' from here to my bedroom, it feel like it's miles away (There's too many rooms)

[Post-Chorus: Gunna]
And I'm still hard body, I don't fear nobody
Phantom whips I'm ridin', all my friendships solid
I get big deposits, all my whips exotic

[Verse 1: Drake]
Revin' the engine, woah
City dependin', I gotta finish it
I want opinions, why?

Find me somewhere out in London, you know that's the hideaway
I need some head and some moral support from you right away
Since I been makin' donations, see you like United Way (You know how I do)
Stories you told me 'bout him, I can see that it's night and day (He told me the truth)
Walkin' from here to my bedroom, it feel like it's miles away (There's too many rooms)

[Post-Chorus: Gunna]
And I'm still hard body, I don't fear nobody
Phantom whips I'm ridin', all my friendships solid

Trunk on the engine
I'm on a mission, the Bronco two-fifty

Life's Monopoly, goin' broke not an option
If they could've stopped it, they would've been did
They would've been dead

Don't you test my emotions
Don't be textin' my phone every day, I'ma leave it on read

My new bitch pussy wet like a ocean, I need a new spread
The solid one, chosen
Young Gun' Wunna stay focused, I can't let 'em put me on edge

No, they can't put me on edge

2021,All I Know So Far,P!nk,"[Verse 1]
Haven't always been this way
I wasn't born a renegade
I felt alone, still feel afraid
I stumbled through it anyway

[Pre-Chorus]
I wish someone would have told me that this life is ours to choose
No one's handing you the keys or a book with all the rules
The little that I know I'll tell to you
When they dress you up in lies and you're left naked with the truth

[Chorus]
You throw your head back and you spit in the wind
Let the walls crack, 'cause it lets the light in
Let 'em drag you through hell
They can't tell you to change who you are
That's all I know so far
And when the storm's out, you run in the rain
Put your sword down, dive right into the pain
Stay unfiltered and loud, you'll be proud of that skin full of scars
That's all I know so far
That's all I know so far

[Verse 2]
So you might give yourself away, yeah
And pay full price for each mistake
But when the candy-coating hides the razor blade
You can cut yourself loose and use that rage

Let the walls crack, 'cause it lets the light in

2021,Arcade,Duncan Laurence,"[Verse 1]
A broken heart is all that's left
I'm still fixing all the cracks
Lost a couple of pieces when
I carried it, carried it, carried it home
I'm afraid of all I am
My mind feels like a foreign land
Silence ringing inside my head
Please, carry me, carry me, carry me home

[Pre-Chorus]
I've spent all of the love I saved
We were always a losing game
Small-town boy in a big arcade
I got addicted to a losing game

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game

[Verse 2]
How many pennies in the slot?
Giving us up didn't take a lot
I saw the end 'fore it begun
Still I carried, I carried, I carry on

You said that I've been actin’ different, yeah
Funny how I finally flipped the script on you
When you the one who's double-dippin', yeah

You're off the lease
Run me my keys
No more poppin' up to hit it, yeah
I ain't even got the miles to trip on you

2021,Way Less Sad,AJR,"[Verse 1]
I should move
'Cause New York is getting muddy out
There's LA
But it's always kinda sunny out
And I don't wanna hurt no more
So I set my bar real low

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a-okay, I'm a-okay
You say it but you just don't mean it
You're so insane, you're so insane
Shut up and just enjoy this feeling

[Chorus]
Don't you love it? Don't you love it?
No, I ain't happy yet, but I'm way less sad
Don't you love it? Don't you love it?
No, I ain't happy yet, but I'm way less sad

And I'm not dead yet, so I guess I'll be alright

2021,Country Again,Thomas Rhett,"[Verse 1]
I quit huntin' with my daddy, guess I didn't make the time
And it's been a year since I've seen a deer, had a smallmouth on the line
The other day, I hooked a monster, and as I reeled him in
I thought, ""Man, it feels good to be country again""

[Verse 2]
I spend way less time in Nashville, more time in L.A.
My back home buddies, they quit callin', thought I had too much on my plate
But last night, we cracked some cold beers and cranked Eric Church to ten
Thought, ""Man, it feels good to be country again""

[Chorus]
Yeah, I love me some California, but it sure ain't Tennessee
And my roots down there in Georgia, yeah, they started missin' me
And I wouldn't change the things I've done or the places that I've been
Man, it feels good to be country again

[Verse 3]
I traded in my Silverado, didn't need no four-by-four
Tucked my boots in the back of the closet, they didn't feel like me no more
But I dug 'em out and slipped 'em on, they've been on my feet since then
Man, it feels good to be country again

[Verse 4]
I traded sunsets with my wife for hours on my phone
And even when I was right beside her, I still wasn't really home
But last night, we built a fire, watched the moonlight kiss her skin
Thought, ""Man, it feels good to be country again""
Man, it feels good to be country again

Have you ever met a real nigga rockstar? (Yeah)
This ain't no guitar, bitch, this a Glock (Woo)

And if I ain't enough, go get the chop

[Verse 1: DaBaby]
It's safe to say I earned it, ain't a nigga gave me nothin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm ready to hop out on a nigga, get to bustin'
Know you heard me say, ""You play, you lay,"" don't make me push the button
Full of pain, dropped enough tears to fill up a fuckin' bucket
Goin' for buckets, I bought a chopper
I got a big drum, it hold a hundred, ain't goin' for nothin'
I'm ready to air it out on all these niggas, I can see 'em runnin'
Just talked to my mama, she hit me on FaceTime just to check up on me and my brother
I'm really the baby, she know that her youngest son was always guaranteed to get the money (Okay, let's go)
She know that her baby boy was always guaranteed to get the loot
She know what I do, she know 'fore I run from a nigga, I'ma pull it out and shoot (Boom)
PTSD, I'm always waking up in cold sweats like I got the flu
My daughter a G, she saw me kill a nigga in front of her before the age of two
And I'll kill another nigga too
'Fore I let another nigga do somethin' to you
Long as you know that, don't let nobody tell you different
Daddy love you (Yeah, yeah)

Keep a Glocky when I ride in the Suburban
'Cause the codeine had a young nigga swervin'
I got the mop, watch me wash 'em like detergent
And I'm ballin', that's why it's diamonds on my jersey
Slide on opps' side and flip the block back, yeah, yeah
My junior popped him and left him lopsided, yeah, yeah
We spin his block, got the rebound, Dennis Rodman
Fool me one time, you can't cross me again
Twelve hundred horsepower, I get lost in the wind
If he talkin' on the yard, the pen' dogs'll take his chin
Maybach SUV for my refugees
Buy blocks in the hood, put money in the streets
I was solo when the opps caught me at the gas station
Had it on me, thirty thousand, thought it was my last day
But they ain't even want no smoke
If I had to choose it, murder what she wrote

If you frontin', I'll be bouncing
If you want it, scream it, shout it, babe
Before I leave you dry

2020,Don't Start Now,Dua Lipa,"[Intro]
If you don't wanna see me

[Verse 1]
Did a full one-eighty, crazy
Thinking 'bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up

[Refrain]
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

[Pre-Chorus]
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

[Chorus]
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now

[Verse 2]
Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word ""goodbye""?
Though it took some time to survive you

Niggas swear they passed us, they doin' too much
Haven't done my taxes, I'm too turnt up
Virgil got a Patek on my wrist goin' nuts
Niggas caught me slippin' once, okay, so what?
Someone hit your block up, I'd tell you if it was us
Manor house in Rosewood, this shit too plush

[Verse: Drake]
Say my days are numbered, but I keep wakin' up
Know you see my texts, baby, please say some'
Wine by the glass, your man a cheapskate, huh?
Niggas gotta move off my release day, huh
Bitch, this is fame, not clout
I don't even know what that's about, watch your mouth
Baby got a ego twice the size of the crib
I can never tell her shit, it is what it is (What)
Said what I had to and did what I did (Ayy)
Never turn my back on FBG, God forbid
Virgil got the Patek on my wrist doin' front flips
Givin' you my number, but don't hit me on no dumb shit

We couldn't turn around 'til we were upside down

You  don't believe it, we do this every time

Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away

I'm  waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away

[Verse 2]
Let go, I got a feeling that it's time to let go
I said so, I knew that this was doomed from the get-go
You thought that it was special, special
But it was just the sex, though, the sex, though
And I still hear the echoes (The echoes)
I got a feeling that it's time to let it go, let it go

Will blow right over while we stay put
The house don't fall when the bones are good

Baby, run your mouth, I still wouldn't change

2020,Chasin' You,Morgan Wallen,"[Verse 1]
We used to chase that Chattanooga freight
Couple of kids in a Chevrolet
Catch a little air when we cross the tracks
Sipping on something from a paper sack
You hang your shirt on that maple limb
Slipping through the moon to the river bend
Wasn't very long I was jumping in, jumping in
I guess I'm still doing now what I was doing then

[Chorus]
Chasin' you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasin' you like those goodbye tail lights
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town
Chasin' that freedom, chasing' that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasin' that you and me, I only see in my rearview
Yeah, I'm laying here tonight holding someone new
Still chasin' you, still chasin' you

[Verse 2]
You always used to talk about LA
I heard you got as far as Santa Fe
Well you know I tried to track you down

I, I hope she makes you smile

In the middle of a highway driving alone
Oh baby, I, I hope you hear a song
That makes you sing along and gets you thinking 'bout her
Then the last several miles turn into a blur, yeah

[Chorus]
I hope you're both feelin' sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy
I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand
I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams
She's everything you're ever gonna need
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me

[Verse 2]
Yeah, babe, I hope she shows up in a 2 AM pic from her friend
Hanging on to a guy and you just ain't him
I hope you stay up all night all alone, waitin' by the phone
And then she calls
And baby, I, I hope you work it out
Forgive and just about forget
And take her on a first date again

2020,Does To Me,Luke Combs Featuring Eric Church,"[Verse 1: Luke Combs]
I was a third-string dreamer on a second-place team
But I was hell on wheels with a full head of steam
When coach put me in
And I'm still proud of that hit
I was a last resort to go to prom with the queen
Thanks to an ex-boyfriend who broke her heart that week
No, I didn't get lucky
But I still felt like a king
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

[Chorus: Luke Combs]
So say I'm a middle of the road
Not much to show
Underachieving, average Joe
But I'm a hell of a lover
A damn good brother
And I wear this heart on my sleeve
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

[Verse 2: Luke Combs]
I was the one phone call when my brother went to jail
Pawned my guitar just to pay his bail
No, I'll never get it back
But I'm okay with that
I was the first man standing next to my best friend
The day the love of his life said ""I do"" to him
I was a couple beers deep
But I still remembered that speech
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

[Bridge: Eric Church]
There's a worn-out blade that my granddaddy gave me
My mama's first Bible, Daddy's Don Williams vinyl
That first-fish-catching Zebco thirty-three
Well, that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

[Chorus: Luke Combs & Eric Church]
So say I'm a middle of the road
Not much to show
Underachieving average Joe (Average Joe)
But I'm a hell of a lover
A damn good brother
And I wear this heart on my sleeve
And I'm a damn hard working
One thing's for certain
I stand up for what I believe (For what I believe)
That might not mean much to you
But it does to me
Yeah, it does to me
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

2020,Death Bed,Powfu Featuring beabadoobee,"[Intro: beabadoobee]
Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed

[Verse 1: Powfu]
Yeah, I don't wanna fall asleep, I don't wanna pass away
I been thinking of our future 'cause I'll never see those days
I don't know why this has happened, but I probably deserve it
I tried to do my best, but you know that I'm not perfect
I been praying for forgiveness, you've been praying for my health
When I leave this earth, hopin' you'll find someone else
'Cause yeah, we still young, there's so much we haven't done
Getting marriеd, start a family, watch your husband with his son
I wish it could be me, but I won't make it out this bеd
I hope I go to heaven so I see you once again
My life was kinda short, but I got so many blessings
Happy you were mine, it sucks that it's all ending

I ask her who got her heart, 'cause damn, that nigga lucky
I been tryna reach for it, but it's too far above me
I ain't never do you wrong, so tell me why you don't trust me
She don't do this often, she said it's only because me
You the one who want it, therefore you can never judge me
She just wanna party and nothing's wrong with that

I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, but I was just kidding myself
Our every moment, I start to replace
'Cause now that they're gone, all I hear are the words that I needed to say

[Pre-Chorus]
When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal, but this won't

[Chorus]
So before you go
Was there something I coulda said to make your heart beat better?
If only I'da known you had a storm to weather
So before you go
Was there something I coulda said to make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So before you go

[Verse 2]
Was never the right time whenever you called
Went little by little by little until there was nothing at all
Our every moment, I start to replay
But all I can think about is seeing that look on your face

2020,After A Few,Travis Denning,"[Verse 1]
I probably shouldn't have said hello
When I saw you out with your friends
I know I should've left it alone
When I caught you looking

[Pre-Chorus]
A little smile, a little how you been
A little touch, a little reminisce
It always starts off innocent

[Chorus]
But after a few drinks
It's always the same thing
We find ourselves lost in conversation at the bar
Then after a few songs
The kind that you hold on
We find ourselves leaning up against my car
Shoulda stopped at one
Said goodbye, given up at two
If we didn't wanna wind up falling into my bed like we always do
After a few
Oh, after a few

[Verse 2]
We always take it way too far
Where it's too much to resist
We always make it way too hard
To walk away after that third kiss

Through the sting of the morning light
'Cause it happens every time

After a few drinks
It's always the same thing
We find ourselves lost in conversation at the bar
Then after a few songs
The kind that you hold on
We find ourselves leaning up against my car
Shoulda stopped at one
Said goodbye, given up at two
If we didn't wanna wind up falling into my bed like we always do
After a few
Oh yeah, after a few

Little smile, little how you been
Little touch, little reminisce
We both know how it ends

2020,Break My Heart,Dua Lipa,"[Verse 1]
I've always been the one to say the first goodbye
Had to love and lose a hundred million times
Had to get it wrong to know just what I like
Now I'm falling
You say my name like I have never heard before
I'm indecisive, but, this time, I know for sure
I hope I'm not the only one that feels it all
Are you falling?

[Pre-Chorus]
Centre of attention
You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I would've known it, baby

[Chorus]
I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, ""Hello""
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
Oh no, I was doing better alone
But when you said, ""Hello""
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?

2020,Everything I Wanted,Billie Eilish,"[Verse 1]
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm bein' honest
It might've been a nightmare
To anyone who might care
Thought I could fly (Fly)
So I stepped off the Golden, mm
Nobody cried (Cried, cried, cried, cried)
Nobody even noticed
I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care (Might care, might care)

[Pre-Chorus]
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

[Chorus]
And you say, ""As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'""

But my head was underwater
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
Coulda been a nightmare
But it felt like they were right there
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down

Ayy

I saw your mama at church
I'm pretty sure I saw your car at the mall
I see your face in the clouds
I smell your perfume in crowds
I swear your number's all my phone wants to call

[Pre-Chorus]
It's kinda funny how I can't seem
To get away from you
It's almost like you don't want me to

[Chorus]
You've got a cold heart and the cold hard truth
I got a bottle of whiskey, but I got no proof
That you showed up tonight
In that dress just to mess with my head
So much for so long
Out of sight, out of mind
Girl, you're lookin' so good
It's drivin' me out of mine

You don't gotta use the door, you can hop in front of tip
Bond 9 in the vent, think 'bout dyin' and get spent
I got two B's on my boxers and a thottie in the bed (Yeah)
I know niggas granted immunity, still didn't tell 12 shit (12, 12, 12, shh)
I got skeletons in my closets (Woah), and they scared of me and shit (Closets and they scared)
Maison Margielas under the bed screamin', ""Rock me, kid"" (Woah)
I put water on my head, then she got seasick (I put water on my head)
Couple opps played dead (What?), and they still got hit
I done bent lil' mama's spine but that still ain't my kid (Still ain't my kid)
Only reason I answer my line (Why?), is 'cause she drink my spit (No cap)
[Chorus: Gunna]

You're all alone at a party, you wanna dance with somebody

You and your girl had a fight and now she's sayin' goodbye
She ran upstairs and packed her bags

[Pre-Chorus: Thomas Rhett]
It could be rainin' on your perfect vacation
You could be stressed about your work situation
Ain't gotta listen to me, but all I'm sayin'

[Chorus: Thomas Rhett]
Ain't nothing that a beer can't fix
Ain't no pain it can't wash away
From the moment that it hits your lips
Makes those clouds look a little less gray
Oh, you could be lonely, or heartbroken
Or hungover from the night before
Turn that frown into a smile real quick
There ain't nothing that a beer can't fix

[Verse 2: Jon Pardi]
You're on a lake and you're fishin'

Pay my dawg a dime to walk him down, he need the racks, bitch

2020,Sum 2 Prove,Lil Baby,"[Verse 1]
You know Lil Ced, that's my nigga, I made him a millionaire, fuck it, we all rich
I ain't tryna have babies right now, so we fuck with the rubber, but I got a raw bitch
Know this money bring envy, you probably wan' be me, but bro, we can't beef 'bout no small shit
Overseas, got the crowd doin' moshpits
Can't believe that I'm still in the 'partments
Businessman, went and got me an office
Million-dollar deals, I get 'em often
Me and Dolla was servin' on Sparks Street
Hot lil' jit, he gon' stay with the chopstick
I got robbed, that shit made me a monster
Eviction notice, my sister, my mamas
Now they houses as big as they want 'em
I done ran up them motherfuckin' commas, look at lil' Dominique
Livin' like we in a race, I might come in first or second, but I won't ever be last
Lately, I been in my bag
Bro told me don't take my foot off the gas
If they give you a inch, go'n and take you a mile
I'ma shoot by myself like a technical foul
City to city, got girls goin' wild
Better not reach for my chain when I jump in the crowd
Lambo' so low, gotta squat
We finally made it, let's pop us some bottles
I took the lead and let everyone follow
They know I'm runnin' it right to the bank
They want me to ease up, I didn't leave 'em any breathin' room, sorry, I told 'em, ""I can't""
Heard you a rat, so you know what's gon' happen whenever we catch you, I run with them snakes
Peep all the moves I been makin', by time I get forty, I gotta be one of them greats
Watch how I move with this paper, I know if I slip up one time they gon' try to come take it
Real as it get and these niggas be fakin', I don't want they vibes, so they hand I ain't shakin'
She on that '42 straight with no chaser
I'm tryna get out of here and go taste her, yeah

[Verse 2]
Wake up every day, somebody harrassin' me
I got rich, they need money, they askin' me
I was sittin' in jail, they ain't look out for me
Ones who need me them same ones who doubted me
I been handlin' my own, they can vouch for me
Head way down with me, know that she proud of me
Turn the heat up, ain't nobody hot as me
Everywhere dollars be, that's how I gotta be
I done gave her the world, now she not leavin'
Say she love me to death, told her, ""Stop breathin'""
He try do what I do, but we not even
I want all of the beef, I am not vegan
Boy, you said it was smoke, nigga, stop speakin'
'Ventador, drop the top, I can't stop speedin'
Tryna see if this bitch hit the top speed
Hit the bitch from the back, have her knock knee
Call me Baby Hov, I control the rock
If the rap slow, I control the block
Yeah, I'm really it, and you niggas not
Got a couple coupes, I can drop the top
I done made it, nigga, all these digits comin' in
I'm savin' for the bigger picture, know one day I'll need 'em
Might as well get used to me
My biggest fear is endin' up a used-to-be, yeah
[Chorus]
Yeah, my diamonds be VV's (VV's)

2020,Emotionally Scarred,Lil Baby,"[Verse 1]
A love letter came through the mail, it said, ""I miss you""
I ripped it up and flushed with the tissue, try to forget you
I ain't got nothing against you, we human, we all got issues
But I'm tired of being tired of being tired
That part of me done died
I see it, then I don't, act like I'm blind
I'm confident it won't be one of mine
I know emotions come with lies, so I tell the truth all the time
Ain't got no sympathy for no bitch
I admit that I'm rich and I'm lit
Jumpin' up on stages, I get two hundred an occasion
Bro had really fucked the game up, we made niggas shut they trap down
They see how I made it, I'm the reason they won't rap now
See me out in traffic, make a hater pull his hat down
The biggest OG's salute me, a stylist can't even style me
The robbers probably wanna get me, I'm hoppin' out Lamborghinis
The youngins turn in my city, they try me, I get it cracking
Some of this still would happen if I never had started rapping
My people them still steady trapping and they still be getting active
I tell 'em to chill, I'm tryna run up these M's
Paid cash and then he post the crib (Nah)
I can't show nobody where my mama live, that's how I 'posed to feel
My niece just asked me were my diamonds real, I said, ""Of course""
I just played the hand that I was dealt, didn't have to force
All around the world they know it's me, they hear my voice
And I done it all in a pair of Diors, yeah

Young age, learned how to get paid (We gon' get the money)
Big stage, long way from Section 8 (Ballin' other countries)
Big wave, he gon' have to get saved (Big old wave)
Ridin' in the foreign, chiefin' on the forest
I know I wasn't there for you, at least I said I'm sorry
You know what it was, I told you that I was heartless
I'm emotionally scarred, that ain't even your fault
But don't listen to them haters tryna fill your ears with salt

[Verse 2]
All this revenue coming in, I'll probably never spend
I just bought my BM a Benz, now that's another Benz
I just cut off all of my friends and brought my brothers in
I don't see nobody but me, who I'm gon' lose to?
I can't move around without tools, these niggas loose screws
I can see me taking the lead over the new school
They remember me from selling weed at my old school
Only hit it once and now it's old news
Blew up, who the fuck would knew? Paint my Trackhawk Nipsey Blue
If I get one, you get one too, I really move how bosses move
I never call myself a G.O.A.T., I leave that up to the people
Everybody can't go to the top, I had to leave some people
I'ma be forever scheming, woke up, I thought I was dreaming
Watched my lil' boy play with toys, I just dropped a tear of joy
Some shit that I feel for
I been going crazy with that scoring, call me Baby Harden
They say I'll be great, I guess I'm waiting for it

One of one, only get VLONE from Bari (VLONE from Bari)
She came with me once, had a wonderful day
Bitch wrote a book and put me in her diary
We fucked on a boat, I'm a pirate (Pirate)
Admit it, I know you admire it (Admire it)
My diamonds dance like parade (Parade)
Matte black Aventador, same color shades (Shade)
Earn your promotion, I'll give you a raise (Raise)
Poured up some potion, feel intoxicated
Float like the ocean, young Gunna go crazy
Tropical bitches, her hair wet and wavy
Put a big double M on my Mercedes

Elevator entrance, not doors

Took her down to Houston to the chachos
Took a million and started a bank
Top of the floor, man, it came with the rank
And you're welcome come party, the hell did you think?
Juggle the beats how I juggle the fame
And I gobble the pain when I swallow this drank
I grow my own gas in the back of the farm
Need the cover of Time so my haters believers
I ran through these seasons with centerfold pieces
Flip the promoter just like we do pizza
Just run me my cheese, we don't wanna go grease ya

2020,Chicago Freestyle,Drake Featuring Giveon,"[Chorus: Giveon]
Two-thirty, baby, won't you meet me by The Bean?
Too early, maybe later you can show me things
You know what it is whenever I visit
Windy city, she blowin' me kisses, no
Thirty degrees, way too cold, so hold me tight
Will I see you at the show tonight?
Will I see you at the show tonight?

[Verse 1: Drake]
Ayy, truck to the plane to the truck
Truck to the hotel lobby
Me, I go through underground garages
Presidential suite on deposit
Elevator up to the room
Shower up and then we hit the club
Touch down, gotta see what's up
Area code in my phone
What numbers do I still have?
Who do I know from the past?
Hit one, she say she got a man
Hit another one, it goes green
Must've changed phones on the team
'Member when you let me in between
That was 2017
All good, Chubbs will look around
Find one that seem my type
That my dawg and he know what I like
He done found me plenty in my life
Problem is, I meet a girl tonight
Then I go and treat her too nice
Galleria credit card swipes
I don't even know if she a wife
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
But I do know one thing though
Women, they come they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday
Monday through Sunday, yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Til then, I'll sit my drunk ass on that runway
On this one way

[Chorus: Giveon]

[Verse 2: Drake]
Jewelry in the safe on arrival
Pistol on J for survival
Lot of people gunnin' for the title
Lot of people tryna take us viral
I'm just tryin' to have a nice night though
Waiter brought the check for the meal
She said, ""Babe, I think there was a typo""
Nah, girl, I got it, that's light though
I could show you bigger things than that
It's gon' be a minute 'til I'm back
Let me give you images that last
AMEX had a limit in the past
I had plenty women in the past
I done plenty sinnin' in the past
You don't need to know, but you can ask
Stickin' on your backstage pass
All access 'cause you bad
You could go wherever with that ass
Show to the shower to the truck
Truck to the club for the party
You go in first with your girls
'Cause I don't know who's out there watchin'
[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
But I do know one thing though
Women, they come they go

I'ma turn it up a lil' more this time
Used to dream about gettin' it, now I got it, I don't drive
I had a spot like The Varsity, what'll you have?
You buy twenty, I'll front what you buy
I put on drip, I believe I can I fly
Niggas know that I'm rich, but they know not to try
I had a show in Detroit and I stopped at Revive
And spent fifty on all of the guys
All of these hoes in these stores make commission
And plus I'ma tip 'em, they holdin' my size
Get in your car and just put on your flashers
And follow the hearse since you say you gon' ride
'Cause somebody gon' die if they fuck with us
Turn a five to a dime, that's a double up
Fuck around, walk through church with my double cup
This shit a habit, I'm prayin' I give it up
Tiger stay with the wood, make 'em give it up
Know I ran through a mil' every week coppin' weed
Bruh beat the charge, I can get me some sleep
Got a backend to pick up, I won't even leave
Run it up, fuck around, give the 'Vette to DT
Keep a hotboy with me, I got love for BG
Chasin' this paper since twelve or thirteen
Runnin' 'round in these streets, it was me and Marquise

Need you, tell me

Panic on the brain, world has gone insane
Things are starting to get heavy, mm
I can't help but think I haven't felt this way
Since I asked you to go steady

[Pre-Chorus]
Wonderin' would you be my little quarantine?
Or is this the way it ends?

Just need you to tell me we're alright, tell me we're okay

Panic on the brain, Michael's gone insane

My wrist look like a snow cone, make her eat it (Woah)
Once I see her, I give her that dope dick just like it's ether
Then I leave her, I can't get caught up, I can't be on Cheaters
There go them people, you know what it is
Go put the dope up 'fore they breach us
Before they breach us
I'ma get out this bitch and I'm strikin', I'm throwin' my heater
Whole lotta money, and still they keep comin'
Forever I'm livin' my life like a bleeder (Slime)

Dope boy (Dope)
I'm straight out the Nawf, I came up sellin' hard (Hard)
Heroin (Dawg)
I'm straight from the Nawf, I went, bought me a don (the Nawf)
I jumped off the porch and went bought me a gun
We boardin' the jet 'cause my dawg got a warrant
We don't give a fuck, bring the stick, where we goin'?
I'm booted up off that Molly, I cover my gun
This stick got a ELO, my aim on point (On point)
Shootin' that Glock give me pain in my joints (Pew-pew)
We shoot a fifty-round drum, honey bun (Bun)
I want two thousand, I want both of they tongues
I know how to handle it, bust on my damages
These niggas can't run, we gon' peel everyone
You know where I'm from, give a fuck how you come
Got a stick in the car and it sound like a bomb (Boom)
I came in this bitch with a mil' worth of cash (M)
Like Bandicoot, we 'bout to crash (Crash)
No remorse, I put five to your dash (Bitch)
Off the porch, bought a Porsche, then I drag
Off the building, them young niggas slide (Slide)
Put up 30, now you do the math (Fool)

Bullets rain, we give him a bath

2020,I Love My Country,Florida Georgia Line,"[Intro]
Yeah, baby

[Verse 1]
Out here, ain't nothin' but woods and water
Drop a beer from a stand, catch a fish with a bobber
Drink a beer out the can, liquor out the bottle
How the good Lord intended it
Yes, he did

[Chorus]
I love my country, I love my country
Six strings and fiddles, whiskey from Kentucky
We keep it funky we like how it sounds
Monday to Sunday, yeah, I love my country
Up loud and proud, rollin' into town
Hanging out the window like a Bluetick hound
Ain't sorry, ain't nothin' to be sorry about
I love my country, I love my country up loud

[Verse 2]
Barbecue, steak fries, styrofoam, plate date night
George Strait, singing greats, while we turning up, sitting lake side
That pedal steel, she straight slidin' over here to me
She do that Alabama Shake, like you ain't ever seen

I like pop, and rock, and rap, I like Skynyrd
And going out downtown when I'm with her
Like driving too fast down a four-lane road
But damn sure nowhere close to the way that

Six strings and fiddles, whiskey from Kentucky
We keep it funky, we like how it sounds
Monday to Sunday, yeah, I love my country

2020,Here And Now,Kenny Chesney,"[Verse 1]
Seen the skyline of New York City
Fireflies in Tennessee
Sipped a little shine from a paper sack that'll
Knock the horns off a Cadillac
I must've sat on a dozen islands
Watched the sun sink into the sea
Been there, done that, got the T-shirt and hat
But my favorite place to be is

[Chorus]
Here and now
Nowhere else in this world enough
You and me, ain't it good to be alive?
Ain't no better place, ain't no better time
Than here and now
Everybody's waiting, but they're waiting on what?
Better get to living 'cause all we've got is here and now

[Verse 2]
Think I fell in love for the first time
With a girl from Mexico
Thought I found a true love in Malibu, but
That water was a little too cold
Yeah, I left a few tears in the rearview
One or two that were hard to forget
Why you think we call the present the present?
'Cause there ain't no better gift than

Shoot your shit up, I got accurate aim
Fucked up a few mil', now I'm back like I came

You know I don't crash, I just stay in my lane
Please don't compare, because we not the same
GunWun ain't no gimmick, ain't clownin' for fame

Work hard for these clothes, cars, and watches and chains
Oh, man, Rolls-Royce got umbrellas, this whip for the rain
These folks done fucked up, let me slip in the game
This bitch let me fuck, this shit went to her brain
She know I'm a beast, and ain't easy to tame

Hit and don't miss, ain't no win, lose, or draw
Came from Flat Shoals and Old Nat
On the South, in that back, you get whacked, then get shot in your car
Why hell you think that I'm maxin'? Relaxin' in mansions, no cappin', 'cause we had it hard

2020,If The World Was Ending,JP Saxe Featuring Julia Michaels,"[Verse 1: JP Saxe]
I was distracted and in traffic
I didn't feel it when the earthquake happened
But it really got me thinkin', were you out drinkin'?
Were you in the living room, chillin', watchin' television?
It's been a year now, think I've figured out how
How to let you go and let communication die out

[Pre-Chorus: JP Saxe]
I know, you know, we know you weren't
Down for forever and it's fine
I know, you know, we know we weren't
Meant for each other and it's fine

[Chorus: JP Saxe]
But if the world was ending, you'd come over, right?
You'd come over and you'd stay the night
Would you love me for the hell of it?
All our fears would be irrelevant
If the world was ending, you'd come over, right?
The sky'd be falling and I'd hold you tight
And there wouldn't be a reason why
We would even have to say goodbye
If the world was ending, you'd come over, right? Right?
If the world was ending, you'd come over, right? Right?

How to think about you without it rippin' my heart out

You'd come over, you'd come over, you'd come over, right?
Mm
[Pre-Chorus: JP Saxe]
I know, you know, we know you weren't
Down for forever and it's fine
I know, you know, we know we weren't
Meant for each other and it's fine

[Chorus: JP Saxe & Julia Michaels]
But if the world was ending, you'd come over, right?
You'd come over and you'd stay the night
Would you love me for the hell of it?
All our fears would be irrelevant
If the world was ending, you'd come over, right?
The sky'd be falling while I hold you tight
No, there wouldn't be a reason why
We would even have to say goodbye
If the world was ending, you'd come over, right?
You'd come over, you'd come over, you'd come over, right?

2020,Daisies,Katy Perry,"[Verse 1]
Told them your dreams, and they all started laughing
I guess you're out of your mind 'til it actually happens

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm the small town
One in seven billion
Why can't it be me?

[Chorus]
They told me I was out there, tried to knock me down
Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house
They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies
They said I'm going nowhere, tried to count me out
Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house
They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies

[Verse 2]
When did we all stop believing in magic?
Why did we put all our hopes in a box in the attic?

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm the long shot
I'm the Hail Mary
Why can't it be me?

2020,God Whispered Your Name,Keith Urban,"[Verse 1]
I was so cold and lost
And nothing seemed to ring true
I couldn't bear the cross
For everything I'd been through
And each day, I knew I needed change
But there was no way, no way

[Chorus]
And then God whispered your name
And that's when everything changed
And love came out of the rain
And talk about being saved
Suddenly I wanna live
More than I ever did
I'm never gonna be the same
When God whispered your name

[Verse 2]
I can see the sunshine
For the first time in a while
Girl, it's like I've been baptized
By the warmth of your smile, hmm
Well, call it fate or faith or call it crazy either way
It's amazin', amazin' grace

And keep that pistol in the drawer

Twelve o'clock, and I got my gun clocked, and I'm on one pill
Monday all the way to Sunday, pick a time to drill
Gettin' my lettuce, I'm gettin' my paper, I'm gettin' my trees (Woo, woo)
One thousand percent, keep it one thousand with me (Woo, woo, yeah)

(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

[Verse 1]
Let me make one thing clear, you can buy me a beer
But you ain't taking me home
No pickup lines, I came here tonight
To shed a few tears on my own
But sitting there across the room, I couldn't help but notice you
Seem a little down on your luck too
Yeah, my heart might be breakin', but this seat ain't taken
And you've got me thinkin'

[Chorus]
We should be drinkin' alone, together
Drownin' the pain is better
With somebody else who got problems, we ain't gonna solve 'em
But misery loves company
Tonight all I need is a stranger
Lips with a whiskey chaser
And a corner booth kiss to make me forget that he's gone
Oh, we should be drinkin' alone (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
We should be drinkin' alone, together (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

[Verse 2]
I don't know what she did to make you hurt like this
But, I know just what to do
It starts with a bottle of good Reposado
And ends with a shooter or two
Tomorrow when the sun comes up, tonight’s the night that never was
Baby, just forget my name
Won't be your one and only, but just 'cause we're lonely
Don't mean that we should

A cross between a zombie apocalypse and B-Bobby ""The

Same reason I wrestle with mania
Shady's in this bitch, I'm posse'd up
Consider it to cross me a costly mistake
If they sleepin' on me, the hoes better get insomnia

Pass the Courvoisier (Hey, hey)
In AA with an AK, melee, finna set it like a playdate
Better vacate, retreat like a vacay, mayday (Ayy)

Laughing all the way to the bank, I spray flames
They cannot tame or placate the

Had 'em just appalled, did so many things that pissed 'em off
It's impossible to list 'em all
And in the midst of all this
I'm in a mental hospital with a crystal ball
Tryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow?
Risperdal, voices whisper
My fist is balled back up against the wall, pencil drawn
This is just the song to go ballistic on
You just pulled a pistol on the guy with a missile launcher
I'm just a Loch Ness, the mythological
Quick to tell a bitch screw off like a fifth of vodka
When you twist the top of the bottle, I'm a

[Chorus: Juice WRLD with Eminem]
Monster
You get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster (Yeah)
I'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (Yeah)
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters
Godzilla, fire spitter, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
[Verse 3: Eminem]
If you never gave a damn (Ayy), raise your hand
'Cause I'm about to set trip, vacation plans
I'm on point like my index is, so all you will ever get is
The motherfuckin' finger (Finger), prostate exam ('Xam)
How can I have all these fans and perspire?
Like a liar's pants, I'm on fire
And I got no plans to retire and I'm still the man you admire
These chicks are spazzin' out, I only get more handsome and flyer
I got 'em passin' out like what you do when you hand someone flyers
And what goes around comes around just like the blades on the chainsaw
'Cause I caught the flack, but my dollars stacked right off the bat like a baseball
Like Kid Ink, bitch, I got them racks with so much ease that they call me Diddy
'Cause I make bands and I call getting cheese a cakewalk (Cheesecake, yeah)
Bitch, I'm a player, I'm too motherfuckin' stingy for Cher
Won't even lend you an ear, ain't even pretending to care
But I tell a bitch I'll marry her if she'll bury her
Face in my genital area, the original Richard Ramirez
Cristhian Rivera, 'cause my lyrics never sit well
So they wanna give me the chair
Like a paraplegic, and it's scary, call it Hari Kari
'Cause e'ry Tom and Dick and Harry carry a Merriam motherfuckin' dictionary on 'em
Swearing up and down they can spit, this shit's hilarious
It's time to put these bitches in the obituary column
We wouldn't see eye to eye with a staring problem
Get the shaft like a steering column (Monster)
Trigger happy, pack heat, but it's black ink
Evil half of the Bad Meets
Evil, that means take a back seat
Take it back to Fat Beats with a maxi single
Look at my rap sheet, what attracts these people
Is my 'Gangsta Bitch' like Apache with a catchy jingle
I stack chips, you barely got a half-eaten Cheeto
Fill 'em with the venom and eliminate 'em
Other words, I Minute Maid 'em
I don't wanna hurt 'em, but I did, I'm in a fit of rage
I'm murderin' again, nobody will evade
I'm finna kill 'em and dump all their fuckin' bodies in the lake
Obliterating everything, incinerate a renegade
I'm here to make anybody who want it with the pen afraid
But don't nobody want it, but they're gonna get it anyway
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like I'm mentally ill
I'm Attila, kill or be killed, I'm a killer bee, the vanilla gorilla
You're bringin' the killer within me outta me
You don't wanna be the enemy of the demon who entered me
And be on the receivin' end of me, what stupidity it'd be
Every bit of me's the epitome of a spitter
When I'm in the vicinity, motherfucker, you better duck
Or you finna be dead the minute you run into me
A hundred percent of you is a fifth of a percent of me
I'm 'bout to fuckin' finish you, bitch, I'm unfadable
You wanna battle, I'm available, I'm blowin' up like an inflatable
I'm undebatable, I'm unavoidable, I'm unevadable
I'm on the toilet bowl, I got a trailer full of money and I'm paid in full
I'm not afraid to pull a—

2020,Go Stupid,Polo G Featuring NLE Choppa & Stunna 4 Vegas,"[Intro: Polo G]
Ayy
Gang, gang, gang, ayy (Mike WiLL Made-It)
Lil' Capalot, bitch, hah
(Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up)

[Verse 1: Polo G & Stunna 4 Vegas]
Hit the strip after school, couldn't wait 'til I got out of class, used to stare at the clock and shit
Before all of this rappin' shit, I was gangbangin' and doin' high-speeds on the cops and shit
And I'm straight from the Chi, but I ball like a king up in Cali and shoot like Stojaković
Keep applyin' that pressure, I go on the run, it ain't no lettin' it up, ain't no stoppin' this
Had to tell my lil' brother to chill, gotta stay in the house, come outside, he be poppin' shit
You ain't heard about us, well, you need to go watch the news, niggas know we be dropping shit
Got the feds on my ass in the hood 'cause they think I'm the one who been buyin' up Glocks and shit
I'm just focused on music, they say my last tape was a classic, but I got some hotter shit (Hotter shit)
Might be rocking a show or if I'm not up the stu', then I'm fucking this cash off
Don't you know Polo G? Skinny tall with the dreads, that lil' nigga be rappin' his ass off
Yeah, I heard she got surgery, still wanna clap from the back just to see if her ass soft
Go like Harden with rockets, we blast off
Tried to throw us some bullets, but we made 'em fumble, like nah, you ain't gettin' that pass off
Spin the block, now I'm takin' my mask off
Hit the gas like we racin', speed off in them foreigns and leave tire marks on the asphalt
It's gon' be R.I.P. once your ass caught
He like frontin', we knockin' his cap off
'Nother day, a new chain or a MAC bought
All this ice got me freezin' like Jack Frost (4X)

In BOA, I'm pullin' them bands out (Cash)
DOA, bitch, I get your mans off (Gone)
A rockstar from the block, I stand out (Uh)
Came from nothing, I fucked my advance off
When I hit the game, with my flow, niggas ran off (No cap), fuck it
I'm not your average joe (Uh-uh)
When I leave the house, I tuck it, uh (Fire, fire)
I'm rich, I don't shop on no budget
He clutchin', my lil' youngin want him a bucket, uh (Score)
I hop on this bitch and run it (Uh)
If I said it, I seen it or done it (Uh, uh)
These lil' niggas never robbed nobody
Ain't caught no body, and ain't getting no money (Cap)
Where I'm from, it's sports or gunplay
We looked up to the killer and dealers
But even them niggas wan' make it out one day (On gang)
'Fore my first M, I been had hood fame (Yeah)
Took off like I was on a runway (Yoom)
I'm a star, but still post on the one way (Blatt)
Them niggas talk, but they won't play (NLE)
We let them guns sing like the choir on Sunday (Yeah, yeah)
[Verse 3: NLE Choppa]
Hop on the scene and I'm thuggin'
This Glock on my hip, so you know that I'm clutchin'
Catch me an opp, I'ma down him in public
The police keep askin', I'm changin' the subject
The way I grew up, man, a nigga was rugged
Why the fuck you got a gun? You not gonna bust it
And a hundred some shots, I ain't doin' no tustlin'
Give a nigga temptation like he David Ruffin
I ain't gon' cap, I don't even like rappin'
But I love wrappin' them bodies and shit
Fuck the bitch, and when I get done
I'ma up my Glock and then rob the bitch
Catch a nigga when he clock out
I'ma get him whacked at his job and shit
And I don't know why the police keep fuckin' with me
'Cause they ain't stoppin' shit, yeah
Spin on your block like a remix
Shoot him in the face, get his teeth lit
Extended clip like a broomstick
Shoot a flick like Netflix
Scratch an opp off the checklist
I just bought a gun off Craigslist
Shoot an opp in the brain, I'm leavin' a stain, only thing you see is red shit
If the police behind, we keep duckin'
My gun need some drawers, it got nuts

[Verse 2: Bugsey]
Flood my ice, make a ho blush
Back at the tour bus, gettin' caught up
DSquared got 'em distressed, gotta hand wash
New racks with the old Nikes in the shoe box
Keep my stripes, no cuffs
Pull up in a new plate and she might just
She weren't tryna move bait when our eyes locked
New tints on the coupé, that's her head lost
Off my whites, right my wrongs
Gucci my mum, while you diddle your thumbs
Count my sums, this is gonna get long
Love my green, I'm tryna get strong
Tryna get bun, where I'm from, it's on
Yes, man don't take no dumb, threats
They see funds, they hop, fence
We been up, not up next
[Chorus: Bugsey]
Don't rush, slow touch
Brown and white, like I go cunch
Grab and buy, make 'em go bust (Buss)
Eye for eye, make 'em lose trust
White rum, fizzy pop (Pop)
Where you dey go? (Go) We dey go up
Catch my vibe (Vibe), let me go off (Off)
Blammed her twice, man it's so tough

[Interlude: Headie One]
And introducing
The one and only

[Verse 3: Headie One]
Big truck, no clutch (Clutch)
Wrist rose, don't touch
French Ciri, I'm so drunk (Turnt)
Course I can't drink and drive, where's my chauffeur?
Bando upsuh, whip that coca
I really hope this time my record don't flop
See, I was in the wok, now my penthouse at the top
Shawty said they're best friends, I bet they both fuck
'Cause they won't cuss, 'cause they said I sold drugs
And when you down there, ain't nobody around
Watch them come back When you blow up
I forgot my jacket but my heated seats help me warm up
Fast train to Inverurie, I used to go up
It's ironic, I just sold out my show in Scotland
Used to say I wanna put Tottenham on the map
But one day I'ma change the map in Tottenham
[Chorus: Bugsey]
Don't rush, slow touch
Brown and white, like I go cunch
Grab and buy, make 'em go bust (Buss)
Eye for eye, make 'em lose trust
White rum, fizzy pop (Pop)

2020,Be Something,Polo G Featuring Lil Baby,"[Chorus: Polo G]
Told 'em I was gonna be somethin'
That broke shit made me sick, big appetite with a weak stomach
Ain't had nowhere to go, nigga, I was lost in them streets runnin'
And I hit Rodeo just to get stylish, ran through three hundred
Just happy I did it, nigga, nobody ever gave me nothin'
Flexin' so hard I might pull a muscle, but I just keep stuntin'
Thirty in the mag, you get body-bagged, I'm just gon' keep dumpin'
Police get behind me, I'ma press the gas, I'm just gon' keep stompin'
I'm just gon' keep stompin'

[Verse 1: Polo G]
Plottin on the come-up, we was schemin'
Now I hit the stage and they screamin'
I was tryna cope through them hard times
For them X pills, I was fiendin'
Got a bad bitch, honey skintone, pretty long hair, she Belizean
Tryna tell you, girl, I can't love you, I'm a cold-hearted lil' demon
Dysfunctional, I can't show affection, might bug out for no reason
Really you don't even gotta be here, I done got so used to people leavin'
You was ridin' for me, then you switched up, now it's fuck you and I mean it
Couple situations left me traumatized, now I say less 'cause I'm speechless
If my brother need it, then I got him, man, the whole gang know how I'm bleedin'
Tryna wake up from them nightmares, devil in my ear while I'm dreamin'
In my past life, did some bad things, I know karma tryna get even
Tryna get away from all the drama, hopped in the Benz, now I'm speedin'

Goofy tried stealin' my formula
Look, these niggas corny, these niggas can't come on my corner
I'm the one do what I wanna
I made the guys spin that bitch every day like a carnival
Bought her a Patek Philippe 'cause she wanted one
These niggas nothin' like me, I am one of one
Take the Bentley, four hundred, I pay the bond
You ain't scarin' no one with no gun in this bitch
Everybody go dumb in this bitch
Niggas hoes and they mama a bitch
In the hood like Obama and shit
Presidential tint, no tellin' who in it
Ask around, I bet they tell you we winnin'
Different foreign cars, ain't none of 'em rented
Hundred million cash, I'm comin' to get it
Out in Cali', but my mind in the trenches
I advise the boy to play his position
Run it up and show love to my city
Never leave 'em, I'm bringin' 'em with me
Keep a glizzy, it's goin' in with me, I can't let 'em get me
No time for bullshit, I'm sorry, I'm busy
I'ma go hard 'til I'm forty or fifty
Niggas be talkin', but they never do shit
So if it ain't money, I don't even listen

2020,Martin & Gina,Polo G,"[Intro]
(Tahj Money)
(I bet my last track probably gave you lockjaw, hey, Lilkdubb)

[Verse 1]
I think about you on the road, when I tear down the booth
Girl, I can't wait 'til I get home to fuck the shit out of you
Even on your worst days, girl, you still kind of cute
If it go down, I'm gon' protect you, pull that stick out and shoot
All I want is your love, can't see no bitch after you
Off emotions, we did things that we didn't have to do
Scared of you leaving, I told lies when you asked for the truth
I second-guessed if you the one, that's when I didn't have a clue
Envy Martin and Gina, but we ain't think about behind the scenes
The way I kill it, lose her voice when she tryin' to scream
We from the trenches, we moved onto the finer things
Now you done went from H&M to a designer fiend

[Chorus]
He was playing games, got you dancing in the middle of the club
Got you dancing in the middle of the club
I know what you chasing, you can only get this feeling from a thug
You can only get this feeling from a thug
Tears falling, and it's liquor in your cup, all you really want is love
Baby, all you really want is love
Only talk to bosses, independent, can't be fucking with a scrub
Girl, I know you can't be fucking with a scrub (Kdubb)

I get this feeling in my stomach when you next to me
Man, I'm tryna get to know you sexually
Take you on shopping sprees for therapy
Move you out to Cali', in my mansion takin' care of me
I know sometime I'm crazy, I was hopin' you could bear with me
Beauty and the beast, pretty girl with a gangster
I swear you still the baddest in the room with no makeup
You the type of woman every hood nigga pray for
I vow to stay a hundred, never change up
In that sundress, damn, your body so amazing
Love the way you smell, I'm addicted to your fragrance
It's somethin' about you, but I really can't explain it
Just know that you mine, I tell that nigga he can save it

Decorate your block with red tape, foenem slidin' every day
Bunch of hollows spittin' out the Glock

Nigga, we was taught to get it off the block
It's a hundred bands in the safe, now I got expensive taste

I been on my grind every day, don't believe in takin' breaks
I ain't stoppin' 'til we chillin' at the top

Swervin' on the E-way, don't care if I crash in this coupe
Shit I'm thinkin' 'bout too real, might lose my mind in this coupe
Can't relapse off these drugs, man, R.I.P. to Juice
We was tweakin' off them Percs, I popped my last one with you
Bond tight with my day ones, ain't tryna find no recruits
We was playin' give and take on that front line with my troops
Ayy, like who want smoke? We got plenty guns
Keep two lil' savages on X and they gon' get it done
And them hollow tips do surgery, they gon' clip his lungs
It was goin' down on the set, that's when this shit was fun
I just been ballin' on these niggas like I'm Kendrick Nunn
Every day my birthday, bitch, it's lit, I just turned twenty-one

Ever since I stepped up in this game, I've been a bomb threat
I was in the trenches, tryna see a life beyond that
'Cause complacent niggas usually die up in they complex
Nigga, where I'm from, they turn death into a contest
Livin' by the gun, put all my trust into this compact
My niggas went to war, but they ain't get no Vietnam check
Lil' bro want his head, he tryna make his brains ooze
Lil' bitch, I'm from the Northside where they raise goons
Took losses in these streets, shit got me singin' gang blues
I been a real nigga 'fore this shit became cool
I'm the type to switch my watch up every time I change moods

2020,July,Noah Cyrus & Leon Bridges,"[Verse 1: Noah Cyrus]
I've been holding my breath
I've been counting to ten over something you said
I've been holding back tears while you're throwing back beers
I'm alone in my bed

[Pre-Chorus: Noah Cyrus]
You know I, I'm afraid of change
Guess that's why we stay the same

[Chorus: Noah Cyrus]
So tell me to leave
I'll pack my bags, get on the road
Find someone that loves you better than I do, darling, I know
'Cause you remind me every day
I'm not enough, but I still stay

Feels like a lifetime
Just tryna get by while we're dying inside
I've done a lot of things wrong
Loving you being one, but I can't move on (Oh, I)

Tell the lil' hoes I'm Bryson

Get popped, nigga, I ain't doin' no fightin'
Sinnin' 'bout cash, I ain't doin' no right

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Car too fast, can't stop at no light
I hit the gas, it skrrt, then I pull off
I'm on they ass, I just took a year off
She shakin' her ass, call me when she get off
Took half a mil' for my lil' bro to get out
That new Richard Mille made me feel like a boss
Feel like I'm Meech when I'm ridin' in these cars
Who you know pull up whole entourage in a foreign?
I got designer for days, but it's somethin' about 'em
Go crazy for white Air Force 1's, maybe 'cause I'm a dope boy
He be loud, but he ain't makin' no noise
'Ventador on the ground like a skateboard
If I want it, I get it, I pay for it
I pay extra, I ain't tryna wait for it
Everything that I got, it was made for me
I was servin' them trap houses faithfully
Everybody with me gotta eat
Say your grace with me

Never thought 'bout doin' music
I was tryna build my phone up
Contacts full of drug abusers
Ridin' around with that Mexican, tryna figure out what my cousin doin'

Swear to God, since I was seventeen, I been hood rich
I be at James Harden house, I'm all in Houston in the mix
I'm talkin' 'bout spare time in New York, I buy floor seats to watch the Knicks
And I don't even know no players
I just wan' show off my new drip and put my chains in layers
I might just stand up and go crazy, someone make the layup
And we ain't squashin' shit for free, you niggas gotta pay us
You niggas better pay up, yeah
Know he might not beat it, I told the lawyer go for a lighter sentence
I don't want know no problems with y'all niggas, y'all got women tendencies
I don't gotta sell drugs no more, I'm bossed up, I got plenty business
Ridin' 'round in that Lam' truck, I wreck this bitch, it ain't rented
Givin' out my respect, get respect in every city

Fucked around and got plugged in, I'm buyin' that red Richard Mille

2013,Can't Hold Us,Macklemore & Ryan Lewis Featuring Ray Dalton,"[Intro: Macklemore]
Hey, hey, hey
Good to see you
Come on, dude, let's go
Yeah, let's go
Hahaha, alright
Alright, okay
Uh, alright, okay
Alright, okay

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Return of the Mack
Get 'em; what it is? What it does? What it is? What it isn't?
Looking for a better way to get up outta bed
Instead of getting on the Internet
And checking on who hit me, get up
Thrift shop, pimp-strut walkin'
Little bit of humble, little bit of cautious
Somewhere between like Rocky and Cosby
Sweater game, nope, nope, y'all can't copy, yeah
Bad, moonwalking, this here is our party
My posse's been on Broadway, and we did it our way
Grown music, I shed my skin and put my bones
Into everything I record to it and yet I'm on
Let that stage light go and shine on down
Got that Bob Barker suit game and Plinko in my style
Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds
But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town
Trust me on my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit, hustlin'
Chasing dreams since I was fourteen
With the four-track, bussin'
Halfway 'cross that city with the back (Back) pack (Pack), fat (Fat) cat (Cat), crushin'
Labels out here, now they can't tell me nothin' (Hey, hey, hey)
We give that to the people, spread it across the country (Hey, hey, hey, oh)
Labels out here, now they can't tell me nothin' (Hey, hey, hey)
We give it to the people, spread it across the country (Hey, hey, hey, oh)

Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Now, can I kick it? Thank you
Yeah, I'm so damn grateful
I grew up really wanting gold fronts
But that's what you get when Wu-Tang raised you
Y'all can't stop me
Go hard like I got a 808 in my heartbeat
And I'm eating at the beat like you gave a little speed
To a great white shark on Shark Week, raw
Time to go off, I'm gone
Deuces, goodbye, I got a world to see
And my girl, she wanna see Rome
Caesar'll make you a believer
Nah, I never ever did it for a throne
That validation comes from giving it back to the people
Now, sing a song, and it goes like
Raise those hands, this is our party (Hey, hey, hey)
We came here to live life like nobody was watching (Hey, hey, hey, oh)
I got my city right behind me, if I fall, they got me (Hey, hey, hey)
Learn from that failure, gain humility (Hey, hey, hey)
And then we keep marching, I said
[Chorus: Ray Dalton]
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

[Interlude]
(And so we put our hands up)
(And so we put our hands up)
(Woah-oh, oh, oh)
(Woah-oh, oh, oh)
(Woah-oh, oh, oh)

2013,Just Give Me A Reason,P!nk Featuring Nate Ruess,"[Verse 1: P!nk]
Right from the start
You were a thief, you stole my heart
And I, your willing victim
I let you see the parts of me
That weren't all that pretty
And with every touch, you fixed them

[Pre-Chorus: P!nk]
Now you've been talkin' in your sleep, oh, oh
Things you never say to me, oh, oh
Tell me that you've had enough of our love, our love

[Chorus: P!nk]
Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second, we're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars
It's been written in the scars on our hearts
We're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again

[Verse 2: Nate Ruess, P!nk]
I'm sorry I don't understand
Where all of this is coming from
I thought that we were fine
(Oh, we had everything)
Your head is running wild again
My dear, we still have everythin'
And it's all in your mind
(Yeah, but this is happenin')

And we can learn to love again

[Bridge: P!nk, Nate Ruess]
Oh, tears ducts and rust

2013,Mirrors,Justin Timberlake,"[Verse 1]
Aren't you somethin' to admire?
'Cause your shine is somethin' like a mirror
And I can't help but notice
You reflect in this heart of mine
If you ever feel alone and
The glare makes me hard to find
Just know that I'm always
Parallel on the other side

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the glass
I'll be tryna pull you through
You just gotta be strong

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't wanna lose you now
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
Comin' back here to you once I figured it out
You were right here all along
[Refrain]
It's like you're my mirror (Oh)
My mirror's staring back at me  (Oh)
I couldn't get any bigger (Oh)
With anyone else beside me (Oh)
And now it's clear as this promise
That we're making
Two reflections into one
'Cause it's like you're my mirror (Oh)
My mirror's staring back at me, staring back at me

[Verse 2]
Aren't you somethin', an original?
'Cause it doesn't seem merely assembled
And I can't help but stare, 'cause
I see truth somewhere in your eyes
Ooh, I can't ever change without you
You reflect me, I love that about you
And if I could, I
Would look at us all the time

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the glass
I'm here tryna pull you through

2013,When I Was Your Man,Bruno Mars,"[Verse 1]
Same bed, but it feels just a little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio, but it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down
'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name

[Pre-Chorus]
It all just sounds like (Ooh, ooh)
Mm, too young, too dumb to realize

[Chorus]
That I should've bought you flowers
And held your hand
Shoulda gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancin'
But she's dancin' with another man

[Verse 2]
Uh, my pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways
Caused a good, strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I'll never, never get to clean up the mess I made, oh
And that haunts me every time I close my eyes

Oh, I know I'm probably much too late
To try and apologize for my mistakes
But I just want you to know

I hope he buys you flowers
I hope he holds your hand
Give you all his hours

2013,Cruise,Florida Georgia Line Featuring Nelly,"[Intro]
Baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Ayy, baby

[Verse 1]
Yeah, when I first saw that bikini top on her
She’s poppin' right out of the South Georgia water
Thought, ""Oh, good lord,"" she had them long tanned legs
Couldn't help myself, so I walked up and said

[Chorus]
Well, baby, you a song, you make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road, blowin' stop signs through the middle every little farm town with you
And this brand new Chevy with a lift kit would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it, heh
So, baby, you a song, you make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

[Verse 2]
Well, she was sippin' on Southern and singin' Marshall Tucker
We were fallin' in love in the sweet heart of summer
She hopped right up into the cab of my truck and said
""Fire it up, let's go get this thing stuck""

[Chorus]
Baby, you a song, you make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road, blowin' stop signs through the middle every little farm town with you
And this brand new Chevy with a lift kit would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it, heh

And strummed a couple chords
And sang from the heart
Girl, you sure got the beat in my chest bumpin'
Hell, I can't get you out of my head

2013,Thrift Shop,Macklemore & Ryan Lewis Featuring Wanz,"[Intro]
Hey, Macklemore, can we go thrift shopping?
What-what, what, what?
What-what, what, what?
What-what, what, what?
What-what, what, what? (Da)
What-what, what, what? (Da-dum, ba-dum, ba-da-do-da)

Da-dum, ba-dum, ba-da-do-da
Da-dum, ba-dum, ba-da-do-da
Da-dum, ba-dum, ba-da-do-da
[Chorus: Wanz & Macklemore]
I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm huntin', lookin' for a come up
This is fucking awesome (Now)

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Walk into the club like, ""What up? I got a big cock""
Nah, I'm just pumped, I bought some shit from a thrift shop
Ice on the fringe is so damn frosty
The people like, ""Damn, that's a cold-ass honkey""
Rollin' in hella deep, headed to the mezzanine
Dressed in all pink 'cept my gator shoes, those are green
Draped in a leopard mink, girl standin' next to me
Probably should've washed this, smells like R. Kelly sheets
Piss
But shit, it was ninety-nine cents (Bag it)
Coppin' it, washin' it, 'bout to go and get some compliments
Passin' up on those moccasins someone else has been walkin' in
Bummy and grungy, fuck it, man, I am stunting and flossin'
And saving my money and I'm hella happy, that's a bargain, bitch
I'ma take your grandpa's style, I'ma take your grandpa's style
No, for real, ask your grandpa, can I have his hand-me-downs? (Thank you)
Velour jumpsuit and some house slippers
Dookie-brown leather jacket that I found diggin'
They had a broken keyboard, I bought a broken keyboard
I bought a skeet blanket, then I bought a knee board
Hello, hello, my ace man, my mellow
John Wayne ain't got nothing on my fringe game, hell no
I could take some Pro Wings, make 'em cool, sell those
The sneaker heads would be like, ""Ah, he got the Velcros""
You might also like[Chorus: Wanz]

I'm, I'm, I'm huntin', lookin' for a come up
This is fucking awesome

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
What you know about rockin' a wolf on your noggin?
What you knowin' about wearin' a fur fox skin?
I'm diggin', I'm diggin', I'm searchin' right through that luggage
One man's trash, that's another man's come up
Thank your granddad for donatin' that plaid button-
Up shirt 'cause right now, I'm up in here stuntin'
I'm at the Goodwill, you can find me in the bins
I'm not, I'm not stuck on searchin' in that section (Men's)
Your grammy, your auntie, your mama, your mammy
I'll take those flannel zebra jammies second hand and rock that, motherfucker
The built-in onesie with the socks on the motherfucker
I hit the party and they stop in that motherfucker
They be like, ""Oh, that Gucci? That's hella tight""
I'm like, ""Yo, that's fifty dollars for a T-shirt""
Limited edition, let's do some simple addition
Fifty dollars for a T-shirt, that's just some ignorant bitch shit
I call that getting-swindled-and-pimped shit
I call that getting tricked by business
That shirt's hella dope
And having the same one as six other people in this club is a hella don't
Peep game, come take a look through my telescope
Tryna get girls from a brand? Man, you hella won't
Man, you hella won't
Goodwill
Poppin' tags, yeah
[Chorus: Wanz]
I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm huntin', lookin' for a come up
This is fucking awesome

[Bridge: Wanz]
I'll wear your granddad's clothes
I look incredible
I'm in this big-ass coat
From that thrift shop down the road
I'll wear your granddad's clothes (Damn right)
I look incredible (Now come on, man)
I'm in this big-ass coat (Big-ass coat)
From that thrift shop down the road (Let's go, come on)

2013,Heart Attack,Demi Lovato,"[Intro]
Puttin' my defenses up
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack

[Verse 1]
Never put my love out on the line
Never said ""yes"" to the right guy
Never had trouble getting what I want
But when it comes to you, I'm never good enough
When I don't care
I can play 'em like a Ken doll
Won't wash my hair
Then make 'em bounce like a basketball

[Pre-Chorus]
But you make me wanna act like a girl
Paint my nails and wear high heels, yes, you
Make me so nervous that I just can't hold your hand

[Chorus]
You make me glow
But I cover up, won't let it show
So I'm puttin' my defenses up (Up)
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love (Love)
If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack
You might also like[Verse 2]
Never break a sweat for the other guys
When you come around, I get paralyzed
And every time I try to be myself
It comes out wrong, like a cry for help
It's just not fair
Pain's more trouble than love is worth
I gasp for air
It feels so good, but you know it hurts

[Pre-Chorus]
But you make me wanna act like a girl
Paint my nails and wear perfume for you
Make me so nervous that I just can't hold your hand

[Chorus]
You make me glow
But I cover up, won't let it show
So I'm puttin' my defenses up (Up)
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love (Love)
If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack

[Bridge]
The feelings got lost in my lungs
They're burning, I'd rather be numb (I'd rather be numb)
And there's no one else to blame (No one else to blame)
So scared, I take off and I run
I'm flyin' too close to the sun
And I burst into flames (Flames, flames)
[Chorus]
You make me glow
But I cover up, won't let it show
So I'm puttin' my defenses up (Up)
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love (Love)
If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack (Yeah)
I think I'd have a heart attack (Heart attack)
I think I'd have a heart attack ('Tack)
Oh, I think I'd have a heart attack ('Tack)

Oh-woah-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
B-B-Be careful making wishes in the dark, dark
Can't be sure when they've hit their mark
And besides in the mean-meantime, I'm just
Dreaming of tearin' you apart
I'm in the deep details with the Devil
You know, the world can never get me on my level
I just gotta get you out the cage
I'm a young lover's rage
Gonna need a spark to ignite

[Pre-Chorus]
But my songs know what you did in the dark

[Chorus]
So light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
I'm on fire

[Verse 2]
Well all the writers keep writing what they write
Somewhere another pretty vein just died (Died)
I've got the scars from tomorrow and I wish you could see
That you're the antidote to everything except for me
Through a constellation of tears on your lashes
Burn everything you love, then burn the ashes
In the end everything collides, my childhood
Spat back out the monster that you see

Well the boys 'round here don't listen to The Beatles
Run ol' Bocephus through a jukebox needle
At the honky-tonk, where their boots stomp
All night, what

Yeah, and what they call work, diggin' in the dirt
Gotta get it in the ground 'fore the rain come down
To get paid, to get the girl
And your four-wheel drive
A country boy can survive

[Chorus: Blake Shelton]
Yeah, the boys 'round here
Drinking that ice cold beer
Talkin' 'bout girls, talkin' 'bout trucks
Runnin' them red dirt roads out, kicking up dust
The boys 'round here
Sendin' up a prayer to the Man upstairs
Backwoods legit, don't take no shit
Chew tobacco, chew tobacco, chew tobacco, spit

And just can't help it cause they just keep fallin'

Livin' at my momma's house, we'd argue every month
Nigga, I was tryna get it on my own
Workin' all night, traffic on the way home
And my uncle callin' me, like, ""Where you at?
I gave you the keys, told you bring it right back”
Nigga, I just think it's funny how it goes
Now I'm on the road, half a million for a show, and we—

2013,#thatPOWER,will.i.am Featuring Justin Bieber,"[Intro]
2014 was crazy
Woah

[Verse]
I heard Puff put hands on Drake
Troy Ave got the ""Tuesday"" kid punched in his face
Chris Brown went on Instagram and told us that his girl fucked Drake
The 'Gram took niggas' followers, they violated Mase
They took 1.5 million, I seen that shit
Mase was so embarrassed, he deleted his shit
J. Cole sold three sixty his first week
Nicki broke up with Safaree and start fucking Meek
Lil Wayne don't want to fuck with Baby
But the contract he signed got him stuck with Baby
I say shit that make niggas think
Five niggas told me K. Michelle pussy stink
Seen Bobby Shmurda on Jimmy Fallon
Jimmy Kimmel, now they got him on Riker's Island
Free the whole GS9
The law hate seeing niggas shine
What they won't say, Im'ma write it
Two cops got killed cause two cops ain't get indicted
They took Eric Garner, shot Mike Brown in the head
And now two innocent cops is dead
And real talk, that's not what's up
The KKK laughing like ""ha, that wasn't none of us""
That probably went over your head
Y'all rather talk about Bill Cosby instead
Or Jay and Solange in the elevator
Do ya know the police upset with the mayor?
Cause he supported the protest
The revolution coming, people just don't know it yet
They know what happened on Love & Hip Hop
Don't know what Young Thug said but still think his shit hot
The realest yearly rap up you ever heard
I'm just stating a few facts and some shit that I heard
G-Unit back together minus The Game
At Summer Jam on stage, niggas took Slow chains
Then Slowbucks tried to set it on Fab and 'em
Cause they was on stage when it happened, they was mad at him
I got to talk about this shit
I'm still bugging now how Angie made that Power switch
Amber and Wiz going through that divorce now
The other day, I seen her twerking on Chris Brown
Suge got shot in the club in front of Chris Brown
Then they tried to say it was meant for Chris Brown
T.I. swung on Floyd and 'em
Rest in peace to Earl Hayes, I did a song with him
Rest in peace to his wife
He killed her then took his own life
Boosie home, Remy back home
LeBron left Miami and went back home
That Ebola had niggas shook
Ray Rice knocked out his wife with the left hook
French got a Kardashian under them sheets
My nigga Jeezy and Rick Ross deaded their beef
But everybody beefing with Iggy
Dre & Jimmy sold Dre Beats for 3 billi
The realest yearly rap up you ever heard
I'm just stating a few facts and some shit that I heard
You might also like[Outro]

2013,Wagon Wheel,Darius Rucker,"[Verse 1]
Heading down south to the land of the pines
I'm thumbing my way into North Caroline
Staring up the road and pray to God I see headlights
I made it down the coast in seventeen hours
Picking me a bouquet of dogwood flowers
And I'm a-hoping for Raleigh, I can see my baby tonight

[Chorus]
So rock me, mama, like a wagon wheel
Rock me, mama, any way you feel
Hey, mama, rock me
Rock me, mama, like the wind and the rain
Rock me, mama, like a southbound train
Hey, mama, rock me

[Verse 2]
Running from the cold up in New England
I was born to be a fiddler in an old time string band
My baby plays a guitar, I pick a banjo now
Oh, north country winters keep a-getting me down
Lost my money playing poker so I had to leave town
But I ain't turning back to living that old life no more

[Chorus]
So rock me, mama, like a wagon wheel
Rock me, mama, any way you feel
Hey, mama, rock me
Rock me, mama, like the wind and the rain
Rock me, mama, like a southbound train
Hey, mama, rock me

Walking to the south out of Roanoke
I caught a trucker out of Philly had a nice long toke
But he's a heading west from the Cumberland gap
To Johnson City, Tennessee
And I got to get a move on before the sun
I hear my baby calling my name and I know that she's the only one
And if I die in Raleigh at least I will die free

[Chorus]
So rock me, mama, like a wagon wheel
Rock me, mama, any way you feel
Hey, mama, rock me
Rock me, mama, like the wind and the rain
Rock me, mama, like a southbound train
Hey, mama, rock me

2013,Power Trip,J. Cole Featuring Miguel,"[Chorus 1: J. Cole]
Got me up all night
All I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night
Constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night
Down-and-out with these love songs
She got me up all night
Drownin' out with these love songs
She got me up all night (Yeah)
All I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night (Yeah)
Constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night (Yeah)
Down-and-out with these love songs
She got me open all night (Uh-huh)
Got me open all night, hey

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Okay, back when I was sleeping in my mama crib
Or even back when I was up there in Mohammed crib
Paying seventeen hundred for the rent, money well spent
No heater, but a nigga made heat, may I vent?
Had a thing for ya, even wrote the song ""Dreams"" for ya
‘Cause I had dreams for ya, thoughts of a ring for ya
Childish shit, you know child and shit
Anonymous flowers sent, you know coward shit
Now a nigga signed to Hov, took a power trip
Back home, I'm grown now, and the city's my throne now, huh
The same clubs that I used to get tossed out
Life got Kriss Kross'd: totally crossed out
‘Cause now I'm in this bitch and I'm totally bossed out
Old chicks crying ‘cause they know that they lost out
But I'm still on you, I'm still on you
My drink spill on me, while I feel on you, I'm sayin'—

And we are, we are, we are
Got me up all night
And we are, we are, we are
All I'm singin' is love songs
And we are, we are, we are
Got me up all night
And we are, we are, we are (She got me)
And we are, we are, we are (She got me)

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Well, this has got to be the longest crush ever
If I ever get to fuck it'd be the longest bust ever
Love is a drug, like the strongest stuff ever and
Fuck it, I'm on one, you feel me?
She on a power trip, she got me where she want a nigga
Wife'ing in the club, man, my homies gon' disown a nigga
Like, ""Give me twenty dollars, dollars!""
Ass stupid, how you get to college, college?
I'm in your city and I'm wonderin' if you're home now
Went and found a man, but I'm hopin' you're alone now
Can't help but feeling like I dropped the ball, cliché
I used to pop up on you at the mall each day
Now, typically I kick game like Eastbay
But you got a nigga freeze-framed yelling: ""Please play!""
For Pete's sake, homie, pull it together
Just fuck her one time and be through with forever, but—
[Pre-Chorus: Miguel]
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want you to want me
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want ya, yeah

[Chorus 2: J. Cole]
And we are, we are, we are
Got me up all night
And we are, we are, we are
All I'm singin' is love songs
And we are, we are, we are
Got me up all night
And we are, we are, we are (She got me)
And we are, we are, we are (She got me)

[Chorus 1: J. Cole]
Got me up all night (All night)
All I'm singin' is love songs

2013,22,Taylor Swift,"[Verse 1]
It feels like a perfect night
To dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes
Uh-uh, uh-uh
It feels like a perfect night
For breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers
Uh-uh, uh-uh

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah
We're happy, free, confused and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical, oh, yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
It's time, oh-oh

[Chorus]
I don't know about you
But I'm feeling twenty-two
Everything will be alright if
You keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if
We just keep dancing like we're
Twenty-two, twenty-two

And all she eat is dick
She's on a strict diet, that's my baby
Uh, with no makeup, she a ten (Ten)
And she the best with that head
Even better than Karrine
She don't want money
She want the time that we could spend
She said, ""'Cause I really need somebody
So tell me you're that somebody""
Girl, I fuck who I want, and fuck who I don't
Got that A1 credit, that's that filet mignon
She said, ""I never want to make you mad
I just want to make you proud""
I said, ""Baby, just make me cum
Then don't make a sound""

You won't find him drinking under tables
Rolling dice or staying out till three
You won't ever find him be unfaithful
You will find him, you'll find him next to me

For money, fame, for power out of greed
You won't ever find him where the rest go

And I can't seem to find no help or love for free
I know there's no need for me to panic
'Cause I'll find him, I'll find him next to me
When the skies are grey and all the doors are closing
And the rising pressure makes it hard to breathe
When all I need's a hand to stop the tears from falling
I will find him, I'll find him next to me

2013,Bad,Wale Featuring Tiara Thomas Or Rihanna,"[Intro: Wale]
Monogamy or whatever you call it
I'm startin' to think it ain't for e'rybody
Most of us is rushin' into it anyways
You know what I'm sayin'?
You ain't rushin' for love, and I ain't up here to judge
Let's neglect the what if's
And make it do what it does, let's get it

[Chorus: Tiara Thomas]
Is it bad that I never made love?
No, I never did it
But I sure know how to fuck
I'll be your bad girl, I'll prove it to ya
I can't promise that I'll be good to ya
'Cause I had some issues
I won't commit, no, not havin' it
But at least I can admit
That I'll be bad, no, to you (to you)
Yeah, I'll be good in bed
But I'll be bad to you
Bad that I never made love
No, I never did it

Bad girls ain't no good, and the good girls ain't no fun
And the hood girls want a smart nigga
College girls all want a thug
So it seems that we fiend what we don't need
Got a thing for a queen who know when to leave
I ain't 'bout to judge you, don't judge me
You ain't gotta really sing about your rap sheet
'Cause I heard you (bad, nooo)
In the literal sense I mean that
Rough sex, sayin' I love ya
But to kiss them is sayin' you mean that (bad, nooo)
I know, I just be callin' her mean-ass
Oh the irony, got the bomb indeed
But the problem is probably a deep past
Still I'm feelin' of somethin' I need bad
Thinkin' if I get her, I get her to need this
I don't need emotions to open your deep sea
I conceive an ocean by goin' between legs
Beg? Nope—bed, floor, dope; go for it, couch now
Slow motion around, put it down
Lord knows she was gone ‘fore the morn', hold up

(Yeah, let me tell you 'bout her, look!)
[Verse 2: Wale]
She hurt feelings, she break hearts
She stay quiet, she play smart
She take pride in goin' out
And gettin' hollered at and sayin' nah
She no saint, but she don't pose
She don't wear make-up by the boatload
Ridin' through lake shore with the nose up
She don't really date much, but it slows her up
She got haters, but we all do
Heard you're winter-time cold, shawty, fall through
Baby, look at they approach, how they court you
All those minds games, nevermind, 'cause they all lose
(Bad, nooo) In the physical sense I mean that
I ain't tryna kiss up, suck up, feed gas
I ain't like them nigga you suckin' your teeth at, nope
Play big, trust me I'll humble yo' mean-ass
Look, shawty is actually in prevent
'Cause the one in front of her is workin' with deep threat
Yep—bed, floor, couch, more
More, shower, Lord, perm, done
Love? Nah, called in the morn'
Cell number wasn't on, goddamn!
[Chorus: Tiara Thomas]
Is it bad that I never made love?
No, I never did it
But I sure know how to fuck
I'll be your bad girl, I'll prove it to ya

2013,Clarity,Zedd Featuring Foxes,"[Verse 1]
High dive into frozen waves
Where the past comes back to life
Fight fear for the selfish pain
It was worth it every time
Hold still right before we crash
'Cause we both know how this ends
Our clock ticks till it breaks your glass
And I drown in you again

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you are the piece of me
I wish I didn't need
Chasing relentlessly
Still fight and I don't know why

[Chorus]
If our love is tragedy
Why are you my remedy?
If our love's insanity
Why are you my clarity?

[Drop]

[Chorus]
If our love is tragedy
Why are you my remedy?
If our love's insanity
Why are you my clarity?

Walk on through a red parade
And refuse to make amends
It cuts deep through our ground
And makes us forget all common sense
Don't speak as I try to leave
'Cause we both know what we'll choose
If you pull, then I'll push too deep
And I'll fall right back to you

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you are the piece of me
I wish I didn't need
Chasing relentlessly
Still fight and I don't know why

[Chorus]
If our love is tragedy
Why are you my remedy?
If our love's insanity
Why are you my clarity?

Singing Radiohead at the top of our lungs
With the boombox blarin' as we're fallin' in love
Got a bottle of whatever, but it’s gettin' us drunk
Singing, ""Here's to never growing up""

[Verse 1]
Call up all our friends
Go hard this weekend
For no damn reason
I don't think we'll ever change
Meet you at the spot
Half past ten o'clock
We don't ever stop
And we're never gonna change

[Pre-Chorus]
Say, won't you say ""forever""?
Stay, if you stay forever
Hey, we can stay forever young

I'm like, ""Yeah, whatever, we're still living like that""

2013,"Bitch, Don't Kill My Vibe",Kendrick Lamar,"[Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise, Kendrick Lamar]
I am a sinner
Who's prob'ly gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me, Lord, forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away, I got
My drink, I got my music, I would share it, but today I'm yellin'
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes, I can feel a new life, I always
Knew life can be dangerous, I can say that I like a challenge
And you tell me it's painless, you don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture when the color blind is hangin' witcha?
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar, another mistake livin' deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick, I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every makin' of his? Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge, even a small lighter can burn a bridge

[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I can feel the changes, I can feel the new people 'round me
Just wanna be famous, you can see that my city found me
Then put me on stages, to me, that's amazin'
To you, that's a quick check, with all disrespect, let me say this

Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm tryna keep it alive and not compromise the feelin' we love
You're tryna keep it deprived and only co-sign what radio does
And I'm lookin' right past ya, we live in a world, we live in a world
On two different axles, you live in a world, you livin' behind
The mirror, I know what you're scared of, the feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to, this shit is vital, I know you had to
Die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain is way more believable
Give me a feasible gain, rather a seasonal name, I'll let the people know
This is somethin' you can blame on yourselves, you can remain stuck in a box
I'ma breakout and then hide every lock, I'ma breakout and then hide every lock

[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I can feel the changes, I can feel the new people 'round me
Just wanna be famous, you can see that my city found me
Then put me on stages, to me, that's amazin'

Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise, Anna Wise]
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, you ain't heard the coast
Like this in a long time, don't you see that long line?
And they waitin' on Kendrick like the 1st and the 15th
Threes in the air, I can see you are in sync
Hide your feelings, hide your feelings, now, what you better do
I'll take your girlfriend then put that pussy on the pedestal
[Chorus 2: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise, Anna Wise]
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
Walk out the door and they scream, ""It's alive!""
My New Year's resolution is to stop all the pollution
Talk too motherfuckin' much, I got my drink, I got my music
I say, bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
[Skit]
""K-Dot, get in the car, nigga!
Come on, we finna roll out!
Nigga, I got a pack of blacks and a beat CD
Get yo' freestyles ready!""

Strawberry shimmer on hot lips
Silver buckle hangin' off her hips
Eyes sparkle when she smiles
Shinedown on the radio dial
Homemade jar of lemon drop, take a sip
Don't stop, girl, you know I love it when you

Summer sky drippin' rhinestones
Turn your party lights on

Ray-Bans got the whole world shaded

[Verse 1]
In the beginnin'
I never thought it would be you
When we were chillin'
Smilin' in the photobooth
But we got closer (Yeah)
Soon you were eating off my spoon
You're comin' over
And we would talk all afternoon

[Pre-Chorus]
Tonight we'll just get drunk, disturb the peace
Find your hands all over me
And then you bite your lip, whisper and say
""We're goin' all the way""

[Chorus]
Tonight, take me to the other side
Sparks fly like the Fourth of July
Just take me to the other side
I see that sexy look in your eyes
And I know, we ain't friends anymore
If we walk down this road, we'll be lovers for sho'
So tonight, kiss me like it's do or die
And take me to the other side

2013,I Knew You Were Trouble.,Taylor Swift,"[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me
You found me-e-e-e-e
I guess you didn't care and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard, you took a step back
Without me, without me
Without me-e-e-e-e

[Pre-Chorus]
And he's long gone when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

[Chorus]
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh

2013,Mama's Broken Heart,Miranda Lambert,"[Verse 1]
I cut my bangs with some rusty kitchen scissors
I screamed his name 'til the neighbors called the cops
I numbed the pain at the expense of my liver
Don't know what I did next, all I know I couldn't stop

[Verse 2]
Word got around to the barflies and the baptists
My mama's phone started ringin' off the hook
I can hear her now, sayin' she ain't gonna have it
Don't matter how you feel, it only matters how you look

[Chorus]
Go and fix your make up, girl, it's just a break up
Run and hide your crazy and start actin' like a lady
'Cause I raised you better, gotta keep it together
Even when you fall apart
But this ain't my mama's broken heart

[Verse 3]
I wish I could be just a little less dramatic
Like a Kennedy when Camelot went down in flames
Leave it to me to be holding the matches
When the fire trucks show up and there's nobody else to blame

[Verse 4]
Can't get revenge and keep a spotless reputation (Ah)
Sometimes revenge's just a choice you gotta make (Ah)
My mama came from a softer generation
Where you get a grip and bite your lip just to save a little face

Pull over on the side of the road
Oh my God, you're something

It don't matter what plans I got, I can break 'em
Yeah, I can turn this thing around at the next red light

Hell, we can all go raise some hell on any other night

Your hair, is it pulled up or fallin' down?
Oh, I just have to see it now

If you wanna call me, call me, call me (Call me, call me, call me)
You don't have to worry 'bout it, baby
You can wake me up in the dead of the night

Swing on by, I'll pour you a drink
The door's unlocked; I'll leave on the lights
Baby, you can crash my party anytime

[Verse 2]
Ain't a spot downtown that's rockin' the way that you rock me
Ain't a bar that can make me buzz the way that you do

And I'm gone so long, hang on

2013,Lego House,Ed Sheeran,"[Verse 1]
I'm gonna pick up the pieces and build a LEGO house
If things go wrong, we can knock it down
My three words have two meanings, but there's one thing on my mind
It's all for you, mh

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's dark in a cold December
But I've got you to keep me warm
If you're broken, I will mend ya
And I'll keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on now

[Chorus]
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're gettin' down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now, now

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna paint you by numbers and colour you in
If things go right, we can frame it, and put you on a wall
And it's so hard to say it, but I've been here before
Now, I'll surrender up my heart, and swap it for yours

2013,Downtown,Lady Antebellum,"[Verse 1]
Well, all the parties on the streets are talkin'
Store front mannequins sleeping in the lights
We used to smoke while we were jay-walking
Like it was your birthday every other Saturday night
Knew the bands so we never payed our cover
Wrote our names on the bathroom tiles
We never dressed to impress all the others
They would let us in on our laid back kinda style
But boy, you know it's been a while

[Chorus]
And I don't know why you don't take me downtown
Like you got anywhere better to be
You talk it up and give me the go 'round, 'round
Like a good time tease
I'm only counting on your cancellation
When I should be counting on you at my door
Did you forget about how we went around?
I don't know why you don't take me downtown anymore
Oh, anymore

[Verse 2]
I got some platforms sitting in the corner
They wanna stroll on a city sidewalk
I got a dress that'll show a little uh-uh
But you ain't getting uh-uh
If you don't come pick me up (Damn)
Show me off (Wow)

2013,Carry On,fun.,"[Verse 1]
Well, I woke up to the sound of silence
The cars were cutting like knives in a fist fight
And I found you with a bottle of wine
Your head in the curtains
And heart like the fourth of July
You swore and said
We are not
We are not shining stars
This I know
I never said we are
Though I've never been through hell like that
I've closed enough windows
To know you can never look back

[Chorus]
If you're lost and alone
Or you're sinking like a stone
Carry on
May your past be the sound
Of your feet upon the ground
Carry on
Carry on, carry on

[Verse 2]
So I met up with some friends
At the edge of the night
At a bar off 75
And we talked and talked
About how our parents will die
All our neighbors and wives
But I'd like to think
I can cheat it all
To make up for the times I've been cheated on
And it's nice to know
When I was left for dead
I was found and now I don't roam these streets
I am not the ghost you are to me
You might also like[Chorus]
If you're lost and alone
Or you're sinking like a stone
Carry on
May your past be the sound
Of your feet upon the ground and
Carry on

[Bridge]
Woah
My head is on fire
But my legs are fine
After all they are mine
Lay your clothes down on the floor
Close the door
Hold the phone
Show me how
No one's ever gonna stop us now

[Guitar solo]

[Bridge]
'Cause we are
We are shining stars
We are invincible
We are who we are
On our darkest day
When we're miles away
So we'll come
We will find our way home
[Chorus]
If you're lost and alone
Or you're sinking like a stone
Carry on
May your past be the sound
Of your feet upon the ground and
Carry on

I'm booking myself a one-way flight
I gotta see the color in your eyes
And telling myself I'm gonna be alright
Without you, baby, is a waste of time

You can't undo a fall like this
'Cause love don't know what distance is
Yeah, I know it's crazy

[Chorus]
But I don't want ""good"" and I don't want ""good enough""
I want ""can't sleep, can't breathe without your love""
Front porch and one more kiss
It doesn't make sense to anybody else
Who cares if you're all I think about?
I've searched the world and I know now
It ain't right if you ain't lost your mind
Yeah, I don't want easy, I want crazy
Are you with me, baby? Let's be crazy
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Well, I wanna be scared, don't wanna know why
Wanna feel good, don't have to be right
The world makes all kinds of rules for love
I say you gotta let it do what it does
I don't want just another hug and a kiss goodnight
Catching up calls and a date sometimes
I love that we're rebels and we still believe
We're the kind of crazy people wish that they could be, yeah
Uh, and I know we're crazy, yeah

No, I don't want ""good"" and I don't want ""good enough""
I want ""can't sleep, can't breathe without your love""
Front porch and one more kiss
It doesn't make sense to anybody else

I've searched the world and I know now
It ain't right if you ain't lost your mind
Yeah, I don't want easy, I want crazy

2013,"Gone, Gone, Gone",Phillip Phillips,"[Verse 1]
When life leaves you high and dry
I'll be at your door tonight
If you need help, if you need help
I'll shut down the city lights
I'll lie, cheat, I'll beg and bribe
To make you well, to make you well

When enemies are at your door
I'll carry you away from war
If you need help, if you need help
Your hope dangling by a string
I'll share in your suffering
To make you well, to make you well

That you would do the same for me

2013,Pirate Flag,Kenny Chesney,"[Verse 1]
Well, I come from a little bitty, homegrown small town
Smoky Mountains, nice place to hang around
Moonshine, that's where they make it
Put it in a jug, makes you wanna get naked
But I jumped on a Greyhound bus one night
And took it all the way to the end of the line
Stepped out in the sun, when my feet hit the sand
What a long, strange trip

[Chorus]
I spent my whole life running around (Running around)
Still let the wind kinda blow me around
Well, I dropped a note in a bottle
To a long-legged model
And I traded it in for a whole 'nother world
A pirate flag and an island girl

[Verse 2]
Well, my friends back home think I've gone and lost my mind
Take a sip of rum and you really would know why
Jolly Roger flying on the picnic table
Blender in the kitchen, willing and able
Don't know what makes you say, ""What the hell?""
But when the salt air catches a hold of that sail
Something 'bout it makes her just want to dance
And she loves to dance

[Post-Chorus]
A pirate flag and an island girl (Island girl)

[Bridge]
Well, I remember back home 'neath the big old moon
Tucked back in the woods, yeah, life was good
But here we are in a local bar
And drinking shooting stars

[Chorus]
I might spend my whole life running around (Running around)
Still let the wind kinda blow me around
Well, I dropped a note in a bottle
To a long-legged model
And I traded it in for a whole 'nother world

2013,Anywhere With You,Jake Owen,"[Verse 1]
If your dream house
Is a double-wide trailer sitting back in the holler
On a country road
Then baby, that's where we'll go
If you don't wanna settle down
We can bounce around from town to town
And that's fine with me
If you wanna just ride the breeze

[Chorus]
I'll go anywhere
West Virginia, baby I don't care
Mexico on a wild hair
Have you ever seen California
Pick a spot on any old map
I travel light and my bags are packed
Just as long as I'm where you're at
I'm gonna have a real good view
I'll go anywhere, anywhere with you

[Verse 2]
I'll bet there's a two lane
Running right through the middle
Of a wide open desert to a ghost town
If you wanna just hide out
We could send a postcard back
From a mountain top out in Idaho
Maybe get snowed in
Anytime baby you say when

2013,Beat This Summer,Brad Paisley,"[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-ho

[Verse 1]
Like the Ferris wheel goes around and around
Well, the trouble with up is there's always a down
First I'm holding your hand and we're on the boardwalk
There's heaven right here on these streets and these docks

[Verse 2]
But the sun keeps settin', the days go fast
And the sand on the beach is like an hourglass
I can just feel it all slipping away
And babe I can already say that

[Chorus]
As long I live, whatever I do
As great as it is, you know what's a bummer
I ain't ever gonna beat this summer with you
Baby, it's true
The taste of your kiss is so bittersweet
I ain't gonna beat
No way I'm gonna beat this summer with you

[Verse 3]
Before you know it, it's all gonna stop
They'll be rolling up windows and puttin' up tops
Be a cold wind blowin' the leaves through the air
And you won't find a tan line anywhere

So let's make the most of what we have left
But it's hard living for this moment we're in and

No way I'm gonna beat this summer with you

[Verse 5]
Yeah, looking at you, girl, standing there
Got your Wayfarers on and the sun in your hair
And just like the song in a seashell, you'll be stuck in my mind
Bouncing around in my head
And baby, I can tell

[Chorus]
As long I live (as long as I live), whatever I do (whatever I do)
As great as it is, you know what's a bummer

I pull up, pull up, pull up in that automatic cookup
B Rich pull up in that rooster 'til we wake the fucking hood up
Got all these pounds of ganja, I work out, I'm doing kushups
Bobby Bands is in the building, pop that pussy throw a foot up
In the air, one time for a nigga like me with a squad like this
With a team so strong with a flow so cold, ain't nothing but some bad bitches in my clique
What's up Eastside
We in this bitch
They think they seeing me
But they ain't seen shit
Girls on the pole yeah they make me rich
Girls at my shows wanna take my pic
Yeah we can do this here all night, can't tell me nothing, can't tell me shit
All in my zone, all on my own
Open that pack, rollin' that strong
And we still up in this bitch, won't turn down, won't go home

2013,Demons,Imagine Dragons,"[Verse 1]
When the days are cold and the cards all fold
And the saints we see are all made of gold
When your dreams all fail and the ones we hail
Are the worst of all, and the blood's run stale

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna hide the truth, I wanna shelter you
But with the beast inside, there's nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

[Chorus]
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

[Verse 2]
At the curtain's call it's the last of all
When the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl
So they dug your grave and the masquerade
Will come calling out at the mess you've made

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't wanna let you down, but I am hell-bound
Though this is all for you, don't wanna hide the truth
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

[Verse 1: Blake Shelton]
I was gonna keep it real like chill like only have a drink or two
But it turned into a party when I started talking to you
Now you're standing in the neon looking like a high I wanna be on
Baby it's your call, no pressure at all

[Chorus: Blake Shelton]
You don’t have to throw back your pretty pink lemonade shooter and lean a little closer
You don’t have to keep on smiling that smile that’s driving me wild and when the night is almost over
Meet me in the middle of a moonlit Chevy bench seat and do a little bit of country song, hanging on
You don’t have to keep me fallin’ like this
But it’d sure be cool if you did

[Verse 2: Blake Shelton]
You can’t shoot me down cause you already knocked me dead
Got me falling apart with my heart talking out of my head
Let your mind take a little back road
Just as far as you wanna go
Baby I’ll do whatever you wanna do

[Chorus: Blake Shelton]
You don't have to throw back your pretty pink lemonade shooter
And lean a little closer
You don't have to keep on smiling that smile that's driving me wild
And when the night is almost over
Meet me in the middle of a moonlit Chevy bench seat
And do a little bit of country song, hanging on

2013,Same Love,Macklemore & Ryan Lewis Featuring Mary Lambert,"[Piano Intro]
[Verse 1: Macklemore]
When I was in the third grade, I thought that I was gay
'Cause I could draw, my uncle was, and I kept my room straight
I told my mom, tears rushing down my face
She's like, ""Ben, you've loved girls since before Pre-K""
Trippin', yeah, I guess she had a point, didn't she?
A bunch of stereotypes all in my head
I remember doing the math like, ""Yeah, I'm good at little league""
A pre-conceived idea of what it all meant
For those that like the same sex had the characteristics
The right-wing conservatives think it's a decision
And you can be cured with some treatment and religion
Man-made, rewiring of a pre-disposition
Playing God, aw nah, here we go
America the brave still fears what we don't know
And ""God loves all his children"" is somehow forgotten
But we paraphrase a book written thirty-five hundred years ago
I don't know
[Chorus: Mary Lambert]
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
You might also like[Verse 2: Macklemore]
If I was gay, I would think hip-hop hates me
Have you read the YouTube comments lately?
""Man, that's gay"" gets dropped on the daily
We've become so numb to what we're sayin'
Our culture founded from oppression
Yet we don't have acceptance for 'em
Call each other faggots behind the keys of a message board
A word rooted in hate, yet our genre still ignores it
And ""gay"" is synonymous with the lesser
It's the same hate that's caused wars from religion
Gender to skin color, the complexion of your pigment
The same fight that led people to walk-outs and sit-ins
It's human rights for everybody, there is no difference
Live on and be yourself
When I was at church they taught me something else
If you preach hate at the service, those words aren't anointed
That holy water that you soak in has been poisoned
When everyone else is more comfortable remaining voiceless
Rather than fighting for humans that have had their rights stolen
I might not be the same, but that's not important
No freedom 'til we're equal, damn right I support it
[Trombone Interlude]
[Chorus: Mary Lambert]
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
[Verse 3: Macklemore]
We press play, don't press pause, progress, march on
With a veil over our eyes, we turn our back on the cause
'Til the day that my uncles can be united by law
When kids are walking 'round the hallway
Plagued by a pain in their heart
A world so hateful, some would rather die than be who they are
And a certificate on paper isn't gonna solve it all
But it's a damn good place to start
No law's gonna change us, we have to change us
Whatever god you believe in, we come from the same one
Strip away the fear, underneath it's all the same love
About time that we raised up, sing
[Chorus: Mary Lambert]
And I can't change
Even if I tried

2013,Love And War,Tamar Braxton,"[Verse 1]
Somebody said every day was gon' be sunny skies
Only Marvin Gaye and lingerie, I guess somebody lied
We started discussin' it, to fightin', then, ""Don't touch me, please""
Then, it's, ""Let's stop the madness, just come lay with me""
And truth be told, I'm waving my flag before it goes bad, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we made it this far on for better or worse
I wanna feel it even if it hurts
If I gotta cry to get to the other side
Let's go, 'cause we're gon' survive, oh

[Chorus]
We stay on the front lines
Yeah, but we're still here after the bomb drops
We go so hard, we lose control
The fire starts, then we explode
When the smoke clears, we dry our tears
Only in love and war

[Verse 2]
Sometimes, you're my general
You quarterback all these plays
Sometimes, you're my enemy, and I'm throwin' grenades
We'll just be chillin' and laughin', I'm layin' on your chest
I don't know what happened 'cause things just went left
But here we go, back down that road
That's just the way that it goes

2013,Runnin' Outta Moonlight,Randy Houser,"[Verse 1]
Don't you worry 'bout gettin' fixed up
When you wake up, you're pretty enough
Look out your window at the cloud of dust
That's my headlights, that's my truck
Come on, baby, don't you keep me waitin'
I gotta go, I've got a reservation
Tailgate for two underneath the stars
Kiss on your lips when you're in my arms

[Pre-Chorus]
Woah
Girl, every now and then, you get a night like this
Woah
This one that we don't wanna miss, no

[Chorus]
Come on, baby, let me take you on a night ride
Windows down, sittin' on my side
Tick tock, now we're knockin' on midnight
Me and you, girl, runnin' outta moonlight
I wanna hold you 'til the break of dawn
Hear the crickets sing a riverside love song
Hey, baby, all we got is all night
Come on now, we're runnin' outta moonlight

Now, girl, I know you used to the same old same
But we ain't floatin' that boat, no, we ain't ridin' that train
Hop on my rocket ship and let's get outta here
Let me put a little shimmer in your atmosphere

Take a few tick tocks off of your clock
Put a little Third Rock in your hip-hop, I got that

2013,High School,Nicki Minaj Featuring Lil Wayne,"[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
He said he came from Jamaica, he owned a couple acres
A couple fake visas 'cause he never got his papers
Gave up on love, fucking with them heart breakers
But he was gettin' money with the movers and the shakers
He was mixed with a couple things, ball like a couple rings
Bricks in the condo and grams to Sing Sing
Left arm, baby mother tatted
Five year bid up north when they ratted
Anyway, I felt him, helped him, put him on lock, seat belt him
Took him out to Belgium, welcome
Bitches this pretty, that's seldom
This box better than the box he was held in
I'm Momma Dee in that order, I call him Daddy like daughters
He like it when I get drunk, but I like it when he be sober
That's top of the toppa, I never fuck with beginners
I let him play with my pussy then lick it off of his fingers
I'm in the zone

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj & (Lil Wayne)]
They holler at me, but it's you
You, this ain't high school
Me and my crew, we can slide through
Give it to you whenever you want
Put it wherever you want
Baby, it's yours
Anywhere, everywhere
Baby, it's your world, ain't it? (Alright)
Baby, it's your world, ain't it? (Uh)

She got a nigga at home, and one on the side
Best friend is a dyke, they fucked around a few times
Her and her momma alike, so all they do is fight
I tell her make me some money, she tell me, ""Make me a wife""
I tell her, ""Bitch, you crazy, fuck wrong with you?""
And excuse my French, but I'm a long kisser
And then she try to tell me I'm the only one that's hittin'
And I say, ""What about them niggas?"" She say, ""What about them niggas?""
You right, what you doing tonight?
Put on something tight, don't judge me, I get life
She love me like a brother, but fuck me like a husband
Pussy like a oven, too hot to put my tongue in
All I had to do is rub it, the genie out the bottle
Pussy so wet, I'ma need goggles
She tell me that's it's mine, I tell her stop lyin'
Mine and who else? She say worry 'bout yourself
Lil Tune

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
They holler at me, but it's you
You, this ain't high school

2013,How Many Drinks?,Miguel,"[Verse 1]
Frustration (watching you dance)
Hesitation (to get in them pants)
Come closer baby (so I can touch)
One question: Am I moving too fast?

[Bridge]
'Cause I ain't leaving alone
Feel like I could be honest babe
We both know that we're grown
That's why I wanna know

[Hook]
How many drinks would it take you to leave with me?
Yeah you look good, and I got money
But I don't wanna waste my time
Back of my mind, I'm hoping you say two or three
You look good; we came to party
But I don't wanna waste my time

[Verse 2]
Temptation (is calling your name)
Sweet persuasion, oh (baby this is a game)
Come closer baby (if you like what you hear)
Impassioned (is what I'm making you feel)

And that six string ridin' in her seat

There's more than miles in my rear view

Well, I'm headed north to what I swore I wanted
And trying not to buy into my doubts
But I just can't seem to keep myself from wondering
Why I'm jealous of all them headlights headed south

Baby powder beach under my feet has got me rolling
And the breeze through crackling leaves like a daytime campfire burning
And the ship is off to sea
And the wake it is a churning

Oh, and lose yourself again
As the southern wind sings again an island lullaby

There's a place the locals go and no one knows where to find it
And the river starts to flow inside the clouds of Misty Mountain
The water from this stone below becomes a blue-green fountain

Drink a bunch of codeine
Serving to the dope fiends
Blowing money, stay clean
Michael Jackson, Billie Jean

Got a Panamera round a young nigga neck
Got a young bitch pulling up in a 'Vette
Smoke a lot of kush and I have a lot of sex
Had to beat the grind up, ran up my check
Bitch nigga get money, nigga, get back
Roll a blunt of chronic, nigga sell a lot of crack
You can hit a nigga line, order what you want
I can whip a Maserati, pulling up a donk
50 thousand on yo watch, young nigga, splurge
Pop a Ace of Spade bottle, sip a lot of syrup
Keep a young nigga workin', gotta buss a cape

Young bitch looking like Janet in the '80s

Two cell phones ringin' at the same time
That's your ho callin' from two different phones
Tell that bitch, ""Leave me the fuck alone!""
See, you fuck her wrong, and I fuck her long
I got a love-hate relationship with Molly
I'd rather pop a ollie and my dick is a trolley
Boy, I'll bury you like Halle
And these hoes say I'm blind
'Cause I don't see nothin' wrong with a little bump and grind
Man, I just received a package

You say I sound silly when I laugh real loud
Talk about my day and you tune me out
You keep telling me lies to make things worse
But I don't hear you 'cause I'm listening to his words

[Chorus]
And he says I am beautiful and when I fall
It don't matter that I'm not perfect
I am beautiful, I'm not alone
And in his eyes, I'm so worth it
I'm worth every tear and every scar
And even when you say I'm not
He says I'm beautiful

Knock me down, won't help me up

2013,Little Bit Of Everything,Keith Urban,"[Verse 1]
I wish I could take a cab down to the creek
And hang a disco ball from an old oak tree
Smoke and drink once in a while
Somehow it’d be good for me
I want a cool chick that’ll cook for me
But’ll dance on the bar in her tan bare feet
And do what I want when I want
And she’ll do it with me

[Chorus]
I don’t need too much of nothing
I just wanna sing a little chill song
Get my groove on
Pour something strong
Down in my drink
Oh, I know
That I don’t need a whole lot of anything
I just want a little bit of everything
Na na na na, na na na na
I just want a little bit of everything
Na na na na, na na na na

[Verse 2]
Now I don’t need a garage full of cars
But I’ll take a whole box of Cuban cigars
And I’ll smoke ‘em nice and slow
Like they were good for me
Don’t need a ranch or a big piece of land
But I like to get a little bit of dirt on my hands
A big ole couch in a big ol' room
Still feels lonely when it’s just you
Yes it does

2013,All Over The Road,Easton Corbin,"[Verse 1]
No sir I ain't been drinking
I ain't even had one beer
This sweet thing's got me buzzin'
From whispering in my ear
Just take a peek up in here
At this little hot mess
Mister, you'll understand
I'm doing my best

[Chorus]
And I know I'm all over the road
I can't help but go
A little bit of left, a little bit of right
It's hard to drive with her hand over here on my knee
When she's all over me, I'm all outta control
All over the road

[Verse 3]
Don't wanna get no ticket
Don't wanna 'cause no wreck
It's hard to concentrate with her pretty little lips on my neck
I say ""Girl take it easy""
She laughs, says ""It'll be fine""
How am I supposed to keep it between the lines?

2013,Can't Shake You,Gloriana,"[Verse 1]
I still change the station
Every time they play that song
Can't drive past your house
So I take the long way home
Your black leather jacket
Still hangin' in my closet
I wish that I could give it away
Oh, even though you're gone, somehow you stay

[Chorus]
And every other time a love said goodbye
I just shake it off, shake it off
Pour another drink so I don't feel a thing
I just shake it off, break it off
Erased all your numbers, blocked all your calls
Tried another lover, built up my walls
Told myself it's over, don't know what else I can do
I can't shake you

[Verse 2]
I didn't wanna be here
But my friends all love this bar
I don't wanna see you
But I'm wondering where you are
And why am I still keepin'
The shirt you used to sleep in
It's been sittin' there for over a year
Oh, even though you left me, you're still here
You might also like[Chorus]
And every other time a love said goodbye
I just shake it off, shake it off
Pour another drink so I don't feel a thing
I just shake it off, break it off
Erased all your numbers, blocked all your calls
Tried another lover, built up my walls
Told myself it's over, don't know what else I can do
I can't shake you

[Bridge]
I can't shake you
No matter how hard I try
I can't shake you
I can't shake you
And I don't know why

[Chorus]
And every other time a love said goodbye
I just shake it off, shake it off
Pour another drink so I don't feel a thing
I just shake it off, break it off
Erased all your numbers, blocked all your calls

2013,Really Don't Care,Demi Lovato Featuring Cher Lloyd,"[Verse 1: Demi Lovato]
You wanna play, you wanna stay, you wanna have it all
You started messing with my head until I hit a wall
Maybe I should've known, maybe I should've known
That you would walk, you would walk out the door (Hey)
Said we were done, then met someone and rubbed it in my face
Cut to the part she broke your heart, and then she ran away
I guess you should've known, I guess you should've known
That I would talk, I would talk

[Chorus: Demi Lovato]
But, even if the stars and moon collide
I never want you back into my life
You can take your words and all your lies
Oh-oh-oh, I really don't care
Even if the stars and moon collide
I never want you back into my life
You can take your words and all your lies
Oh-oh-oh, I really don't care
Oh-oh-oh, I really don't care

[Verse 2: Demi Lovato]
I can't believe I ever stayed up writing songs about you
You don't deserve to know the way I used to think about you
Oh, no, not anymore, oh, no, not anymore
You had your shot, had your shot, but you let go
Now if we meet out on the street, I won't be running scared
I'll walk right up to you and put one finger in the air
And make you understand, and make you understand
You had your chance, had your chance

But, even if the stars and moon collide
I never want you back into my life
You can take your words and all your lies
Oh-oh-oh, I really don't care
Even if the stars and moon collide
I never want you back into my life
You can take your words and all your lies
Oh-oh-oh, I really don't care
Oh-oh-oh, I really don't care

[Bridge: Cher Lloyd]
Yeah, listen up
Hey, hey, never look back
Dumbstruck boy, ego intact
Look, boy, why you so mad?
Second-guessin', but should've hit that
Hey, Demi, you picked the wrong lover
Should've picked that one, he's cuter than the other
I just wanna laugh, 'cause you tryna be a hipster
Kick it to the curb, take a Polaroid picture

[Chorus: Demi Lovato]
But, even if the stars and moon collide
I never want you back into my life
You can take your words and all your lies

2013,I Drive Your Truck,Lee Brice,"[Verse 1]
Eighty-nine cents in the ashtray
Half-empty bottle of Gatorade rollin' in the floorboard
That dirty Braves cap on the dash
Dog tags hangin' from the rearview
Old Skoal can and cowboy boots
And a Go Army shirt folded in the back

[Pre-Chorus]
This thing burns gas like crazy, but that's alright
People got their ways of copin', oh, and I've got mine

[Chorus]
I drive your truck
I roll every window down
And I burn up
Every back road in this town
I find a field, I tear it up
'Til all the pain's a cloud of dust
Yeah, sometimes
I drive your truck

[Verse 2]
I leave that radio playin'
That same ol' country station where ya left it
Yeah, man I crank it up
And you'd probably punch my arm right now
If you saw this tear rollin' down on my face
Hey, man I'm tryin' to be tough
[Pre-Chorus]
And momma asked me this mornin' if I'd been by your grave
But that flag and stone ain't where I feel you anyway

[Chorus]
I drive your truck
I roll every window down
And I burn up
Every back road in this town
I find a field, I tear it up
'Til all the pain's a cloud of dust
Yeah, sometimes
I drive your truck

[Bridge]
I've cussed, I've prayed, I've said goodbye
Shook my fist and asked God why
These days when I'm missin' you this much

[Chorus]
I drive your truck
I roll every window down
And I burn up
Every back road in this town
I find a field, I tear it up
'Til all the pain's a cloud of dust
Yeah, sometimes (Brother, sometimes)

Salt in the wound like you're laughin' right at me

""Oh, don't you dare look back
Just keep your eyes on me""
I said, ""You're holding back""
She said, ""Shut up and dance with me""
This woman is my destiny

The chemical, physical kryptonite
Helpless to the bass and the fading light
Oh, we were bound to get together
Bound to get together

2015,Want To Want Me,Jason Derulo,"[Intro]
Derulo

[Verse 1]
It's too hard to sleep
I got the sheets on the floor, nothing on me
And I can't take it no more, it's a hundred degrees
I got one foot out the door, where are my keys? 'Cause I gotta leave, yeah
In the back of the cab (ooh)
I tipped the driver 'head of time, get me there fast (Ooh)
I got your body on my mind, I want it bad (Ooh)
Ooh, just the thought of you gets me so high, so high

[Chorus]
Girl, you're the one I want to want me
And if you want me, girl, you got me
There's nothing I, no, I wouldn't do (I wouldn't do)
Just to get up next to you

2015,Nasty Freestyle,T-Wayne,"[Produced by 30 Roc]

[Intro]
Yah, say Roro, you know what it is, right?
Who Is Rickey Wayne?: The Mixtape
Ya feel me? Yah, ahem

[Verse]
First, let me hop out the muh fuckin' Porsche
I don't want her if that ass don't sit like a horse
I be ballin' on these niggas, got me feelin' like sports
Dash got so much wood I could build me a fort
Ain't too many things I ain't done yet
I'm the king of this shit, crown by the toilet
I'm just barely gettin' started, you already upset
Got a tiger as a pet, I just took him to the vet
Homie, I be makin' hits, I'm the rap Derek Jeter
Let your bitch ride on me like she was on the feeder
If the pussy ain't good then I probably won't feed her
Lil homie, you can keep her cause I really don't need her
I ain't worried 'bout features, homeboy, you's a peon
Toilet seat ass nigga, man, I swear you gettin' peed on
Man, my jewelry so cold, I walk around with the heat on
My alarm clock set, just in case they wanna sleep on, ya dig?
I'm a full-time player, hoppin' out in alligator
Sippin' lean and Now and Later, homie, I'll annihilate ya
If you think you wanna battle, you gon' have to pay some paper
I just hit her and I quit her, I would never ever date her
It's a shame how I'm barely gettin' love in the city
Travel to another town, you can bet they fuckin' with me
I be killin' this shit, pray to God they forgive me
They said, ""when you blow up, don't forget me"", man
I been on fire ever since they made the lighter
My boys will pull up on ya, homie, I ain't talkin' diapers
Walk into your function, on point, I'm like a sniper
My girl bad like Dej Loaf so don't try her
Flexin' all you want but homeboy, you ain't ready
Ten times sharper than Michael Myers' machete

2015,Thinking Out Loud,Ed Sheeran,"[Verse 1]
When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And darlin', I will be lovin' you till we're seventy
And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm thinkin' 'bout how
People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well, me, I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am

[Chorus]
So honey, now, take me into your lovin' arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
And place your head on my beatin' heart, I'm thinkin' out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are

[Verse 2]
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mmm
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory

I say no way, try again another day
I should be happy, not tipping the scales
I just won't play letting my life get away

I don't take things as they come
If they bring me down
Life can be cruel if you're a dreamer
I just wanna have some fun
Don't tell me what could be done

And I got that red lip classic thing that you like

2015,B**** Better Have My Money,Rihanna,"[Intro]
When you see me at the shows
Or when you write my details on the envelopes
And you're thinking how to address me
Well I suppose
LT or Monk
Never 'the' though...
LTtheBohemian
LTtheWordPlaya
LTtheShaolinTempleRhymeSlayer

[Verse]
Call me the coach like Junior Damon Wayans
Niggalodeon even like Kel and Kenan
LTtheBohemian
So Afeni in the way I got the Pac foundation
So much weight on being real
I won't even say rass clart cause I don't want to sound Ja-faking
Rides I'm taking
Unaware of my trajectory
I be susceptible to the pain I'm heavily affected
By the thoughts of if I'll make it
Where I'm gonna fit in
May end up a dead end but fuck it I'll live in
The moment
Now I got Richard Pryor's booster
Rapping till I got more millions than Brewster
Gems like Obey Your Thirst
Like I'm chop and screwed up
With the dirty Sprite
Way I'm 'repping the South like dirty Nikes
Cause even when you can't see the logo
You know where I roam though
You might also like[Hook]
I'm L T T H E
Wasn't proud to say I was from BR3
Always thought it wasn't where you from
But where you at
But where you find the Monk?
In the Temple with the raps
In the Temple with the raps
In the Temple with the raps

[Verse 2]
LTtheWordPlaya
Been a voice for the kids that really hear me
Homies really with me
Only hit the drugs with those that I trust
I might be so euphoric a description is a must
Like this high is godly
For all I know I just got Bill Cosby'd
Wake up in the morning with a Hollywood type
Whose face be so cocky
Telling me the infamous date rape is her hobby
So I got to be
LTtheWiseOne
Seeing niggas die some
Way across the water
But that shit be feeling like it happened round the corner
As a result
Time to abort the
Vision of a pretty picture
We living in a world where the parents ain't together
And you ain't share full blood with your bruv or sister
But we ain't call them half
It's 100 or nothing
[Hook 2]
You got Redman, Method Man and Duffman
No I'm the Monk man
Bringing the funk man
Ah shit, I should have just flipped the 1st hook
Man, it's the Monk man

It's the Monk man, it's the Monk man
It's the Monk man
LTtheMonk-Freeman in this
Peace to Huey, Riley and Django

[Verse 3]
I'm LTtheShaolinTempleRhymeSlayer
Give me Dave Chappelle, Questlove and John Mayer
Riff will make the white kids peel back the layers
The drummer makes the black kids rewind the players...
LTthe
Yo can I ever wear that fine Lo?
Can I get a chick that be looking as fine as J-Lo?
Can I get made in Manhattan
Dirty on the low?
Can I get a clean sweep
Dominate award show?
Can I get around the world?
That Maya Angelou
Can I be the Black Messiah?
On my D'Angelo
Yo can I open up
Behind the velvet rope?
And can I stick my Charles Dickens deep inside her throat?
The Monk is running the London Dungeon
No fun in dealing this shit in abundance
If runners won't bring my ruckus
So brothers get on the corner
And suckers I'll make redundant
But before you hit the mortuary
Better have my money
So Rih
Sorry Rihanna but my dreams of fucking R&B bitches
So out of hand
If I make it out to Los Angeles
I may release the plan that Borat had for Pamela
Put you in the bag bring you back to London and marry ya'
So if you're signing CDs
And you look up and see these nuts

2015,Kick The Dust Up,Luke Bryan,"[Intro]
Kick the dust up, c'mon

[Verse 1]
All week long it’s a farmin’ town
They’re makin’ that money grow
Tractors, plows with flashing lights
Backin’ up a two lane road
They take one last lap around
That sun up high goes down
And then it's on, come on
Girl kick it on back
Z71 like a Cadillac

[Chorus]
We go way out where
There ain’t nobody
We turn this cornfield
Into a party
Pedal to the floorboard
Eight up in a four door
Burnin’ up a back road song
Park it and we pile out
Baby, watch your step now
Better have your boots on
Kick the dust up
Back it on up
Fill your cup up
Let’s tear it up, up
And kick the dust up (kick the dust up...)
See Luke Bryan LiveGet tickets as low as $26You might also like[Verse 2]
Bar downtown they got a line
Of people way out the door
$10 dollar drinks, it’s packed inside
I don’t know what they’re waitin for
Got me a jar full of clear
And I got that music for your ears
And it’s like knock, knock, knock goes the diesel
If you really wanna see the beautiful people

[Chorus]
We go way out where
There ain’t nobody
We turn this cornfield
Into a party
Pedal to the floorboard
Eight up in a four door
Burnin’ up a back road song
Park it and we pile out
Baby, watch your step now
Better have your boots on
Kick the dust up
Let's back it on up
Fill your cup up
Let’s tear it up, up

2015,Blank Space,Taylor Swift,"[Verse 1]
Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
""Oh, my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?"" Ayy
New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So, hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, mm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the king, baby, I'm your queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh, no
Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing, like
""Oh, my God, who is she?""
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless (Oh)
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless (Oh-oh), mm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane (Insane)
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name
[Bridge]
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over (Over), mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane (I'm insane)
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game (And you love the game)
'Cause we're young and we're reckless (Yeah)
We'll take this way too far (Ooh)

Or with a nasty scar (With a nasty scar)
Got a long list of ex-lovers

Wanted to fight this war without weapons
And I wanted it, I wanted it bad

But you won't see me fall apart

And another one bites the dust
It's hard to lose a chosen one

[Verse 1]
She's calling me, with a gentle touch
A love so real, it was far too much
For a boy like me, a worried mind
To believe in you, I gotta close my eyes

[Chorus]
You want me to say, please
Baby I can say, please
You want me to get down on my knees
Baby I can get down on my knees

[Verse 2]
The will was strong, but my legs were weak
I could not walk and I could not speak
The love that you gave me was so way down south
Baby I was born just to kiss your mouth
So I became a part of you
And you became a part of me
See I had no choice but to lie to you, see
If I told you the truth, you'd have set me free
You'd have set me free

I was a liar, I gave in to the fire
I know I should've fought it, at least I'm bein' honest
Feel like a failure 'cause I know that I failed you
I should've done you better 'cause you don't want a liar

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know, and I know, and I know she gives you everything
But, boy, I couldn't give it to you
And I know, and I know, and I know that you got everything
But I got nothin' here without you

[Chorus]
So, one last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
One more time
I promise after that, I'll let you go
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home

[Verse 2]
I don't deserve it, I know I don't deserve it

2015,Take Your Time,Sam Hunt,"[Verse 1]
I don't know if you were looking at me or not
You probably smile like that all the time
I don't mean to bother you but
I couldn't just walk by
And not say, ""Hi""
And I know your name
'Cause everybody in here knows your name
You're not looking for anything right now
So, I don't wanna come on strong
Don't get me wrong
Your eyes are so intimidating
My heart is pounding but
It's just a conversation
No girl, I'm not wasted
You don't know me
I don't know you
But I want to

[Chorus]
And I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me
I just wanna take your time
I don't wanna wreck your Friday
I ain't gonna waste my lines
I don't have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time

And I know it starts with ""Hello""
The next thing you know you try to be nice
And some guys gettin' too close
Trying to pick you up
Trying to get you drunk
And I'm sure one of your friends is about to come over here
'Cause she's supposed to save you from random guys that talk too much
And wanna stay too long
It's the same old song
And dance, but I think you know it well
You could've rolled your eyes, told me to go to hell
Could've walked away, but you're still here
And I'm still here
Come on, let's see where it goes

[Chorus]
I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me
I just wanna take your time
I don't have to meet your mother
We don't have to cross that line
I don't wanna steal your covers
I just wanna take your time
[Bridge]
Woah
I don't wanna go home with you
Woah
I just wanna be alone with you

[Chorus]
I don't wanna steal your freedom (Freedom)
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me (You love me)
I just wanna take your time
I don't wanna blow your phone up
I just wanna blow your mind
I don't have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time
No, I ain't gotta call you ""Baby""

We've got the last two glasses on a straw hut bar
Tryin' to remember what number we are
String of white lights making your eyes shine tonight

Your skin is begging to be kissed by a little more than the sun
You take my hand in yours, you lean in and
Your lips taste like sangria

2015,Blessings,Big Sean Featuring Drake,"[Intro: Drake & Big Sean]
Look
I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed
(Straight up)
[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I live the life I deserve, blessed
Fuck a vacay, I feel better at work
I mean, whatever it's worth, I give whatever I'm worth
For my niggas who gon' go to Hell and back for me
I'ma give 'em Heaven on Earth
Or a hell of a check, yeah, whichever come first
Blessings on blessings on blessings
Look at my life, man, that's lessons on lessons on lessons
I treat the beat like it's a reverend
I tell the truth like, ""Father, forgive me, these are all my confessions""
Man, this wasn't luck, it was destined
I done lost homies who been with me since Ed, Edd n Eddy
Who flip like confetti
And then when you back, they back to call you ""dog""
That shit get-get petty
Bitch, don't give no dap to me, nigga
Funny thing about talking behind my back
Is that it just keep coming back to me, nigga
Was off for a sec, now it's back to me, nigga, you mad at me
This ain't what I want, man, this what it had to be
This is that late night working after three, man
This is why my old girl was mad at me
This why I'm your majesty, man
The clique is the tightest, the pussy the tightest
The drinks are the coldest, the future the brightest
The feat not divided, the love is divided
And I just gotta thank God that we got it
Blessed
I don't know what I would do without it
Crew look like we robbed a bank, but all we make is deposits
Your prophet will profit, oh God

Way up, I feel blessed (Straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed (Straight up, straight up)
Way up, I feel blessed

[Verse 2: Drake]
Look, I ain't gon' say that we back or nothing
‘Cause that implies that we're back from something
If we're back from somethin' there's some checks you owe us
I expect that payment, nothing less or over
I don't need them favors that you ask me for
I could give two fucks 'bout where the Grammys go
I just gave out Grammys on my Instagram
Them OVO boys, the business man
It is what it is, trust me, you get what you give, yeah
You gotta come to my side and see how we live, yeah
I cannot see Heaven being much better than this, yeah
Blessings on blessings for me and my niggas from the 6
Look at what we did, yeah
Be quiet, I'm doing a toast
For niggas that don't really do shit, I swear, y'all be doing the most
Stop worrying 'bout whoever's next
I am just worried 'bout my mama worrying less
I think I'm famous enough
I don't need any more press
I am convinced I'm the only one left that's still doing this shit, man
[Chorus: Drake & Big Sean]
I'm here for a good time, not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed (Straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed (Straight up, straight up)
Way up, I feel blessed

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
My grandma just died, I'm the man of the house
So every morning I'm up 'cause I can't let them down, down
Always down for the cause, never down for the count
I guess when your stars align
You do like the solar system and plan it out
So I'm going over time, on the overtime
Yeah, I'm that invested, but you can't attest it
Million dollar goals, managed to manifest it
The family never going anorexic
I pay my own mortgage and electric
Never going under even with anesthetics
At the top of the rap game and progressin'
Check after check, checking off my check list
Try and blow my cake, just know that's a death wish
No mistakes in life ever, it's only lessons
Shit feel like Shaq and Penny got back together
You tore the game apart, who put it back together? I
[Chorus: Drake & Big Sean]
I'm here for a good time, not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed (Straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed (Straight up, straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed
[Verse 4: Kanye West]
Since the truth keep niggas traumatized
They tryna compromise my condom size
So I Snapchat that whole shit
Tryna see titties, tryna show dick
And I swear to God, I hope they post it, I'm blessed
Even though I get slammed with lawsuits like car doors
See three P.O.'s like Star Wars
They want me by the road holding up cardboard
So I go extra hard on the hard floor
Right now, I'm calling you from my home gym
Right after that, nigga, I'm gon' swim
Just did a couple laps in my home pool
And my daughter right there getting home-schooled, I'm blessed
And I was thinking 'bout starting up my own school, a Montessori
And the hallway looking like a monastery, oh, yes

I knew my rent was gon' be late about a week ago (Hey)

But I'ma have a good time ballin' tonight
Tell the bartender, ""Line up some shots""
'Cause I'ma get loose tonight
She's on fire, she's so hot
I'm no liar, she burned up the spot
Look like Mariah, I took another shot
And told her drop, drop, drop, drop it like it's hot
Dirty talk (Hey), dirty dance (Hey)
She a freaky girl (Hey) and I'm a freaky man (Hey)
She on the rebound, broke up with her ex
And I'm like Rodman, ready on deck
I told her, ""Wanna ride out?"" And she said, ""Yes""

2015,Take Me To Church,Hozier,"[Verse 1]
My lover's got humour
She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshipped her sooner
If the heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's gettin' more bleak
A fresh poison each week
We were born sick, you heard them say it
My church offers no absolutes
She tells me, ""Worship in the bedroom""
The only heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you
I was born sick, but I love it
Command me to be well

[Pre-Chorus]
A, amen
Amen, amen

[Chorus]
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life

If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice
Drain the whole sea, get somethin' shiny
Somethin' meaty for the main course
That's a fine lookin' high horse
What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starvin' faithful
That looks tasty, that looks plenty
This is hungry work

[Chorus]
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins, so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins, so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life

[Bridge]
No masters or kings when the ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then, I am human, only then, I am clean
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh, amen
Amen, amen

[Chorus]
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life

Girl, you melt me like ice in whiskey
With those blue flame looks that you give me
You can't hide what's inside
And it's killing me right now to see you wanna slip off with me again

[Chorus]
Why should we go 'round and 'round the truth, like we've been doin'?
Every time we lie, girl, we're losin'
So why should we spend Saturday night alone
When I can call you on the phone, pick you up
Make it up as we go along
Pull an all nighter, chasin' that desire
Sparks flyin' in her eyes like lighters (Like lighters)
Get a little higher (Get a little higher)
Sippin' on fire (Sippin' on fire)

[Verse 2]
You act like you don't know what you're missin'
Every time you end up back with him
'Cause it's safe, and you're scared
Of everything you're feelin' when we're burnin' the midnight down again

[Chorus]
Why should we go 'round and 'round the truth, like we've been doin'?
Every time we lie, girl, we're losin'
So why should we spend Saturday night alone
When I can call you on the phone, pick you up
Make it up as we go along

Yo

[Verse 1]
Ayo, tonight is the night that I'ma get twisted
Myx Moscato and vodka, I'ma mix it
Roll that spaceship, we 'bout to get lifted
Live in the present, that gift is for the gifted
This what you came, this what you came for
You get what you buy, this what you paid for
So make sure the stars is what you aim for
Make mistakes, though

2015,Smoke,A Thousand Horses,"[Verse 1]
She comes rolling right off the tip of my tongue so easy
She'll be the first damn thing I want when I start drinking
I'm breathing her in, breathing her out, once I pick her up I can't put her down

[Chorus]
She's smoke
I pull her in nice and slow
She's a habit and I can't let go
Blowing rings around my heart
The one she stole
Watching her sway and go
It's killing me and I know
Can't stop her once you start
She's smoke

[Verse 2]
She'll go floating around like a downtown ballroom gypsy
She goes great with ice cold beer or a shot of whiskey
Put one in my hand, her on my lips
Man, that's as good as it gets

[Chorus]
She's smoke
I pull her in nice and slow
She's a habit and I can't let go
Blowing rings around my heart
The one she stole
Watching her sway and go
It's killing me and I know
Can't stop her once you start
She's smoke

Hard to make a song 'bout somethin' other than the money
Two things I'm about it are talkin' blunt and stayin' blunted
Pretty women, are you here? Are you here right now, huh?
We should all disappear right now
Look, you're gettin' all your friends and you're gettin' in the car
And you're comin' to the house, are we clear right now, huh?
You see the fleet of all the new things
Cop cars with the loose change
All white like I move things
Niggas see me rollin' and they mood change
Like a motherfucker
New flow, I got a dozen of 'em
I don't trust you, you a undercover
I could probably make some stepsisters fuck each other
Woo, talkin' filets with the truffle butter

And I ain't talkin' about that Lil Wayne record
I'm still the highest sellin' female rapper for the record
Man, this the sixty-five millionth single sold
I ain't gotta compete with a single soul
I'm good with the ballpoint game, finger roll
Ask me how to do it, I don't tell a single soul
Pretty women, what's up? Is you here right now?
You a stand-up or is you in your chair right now? Uh
Do you hear me? I can't let a wack nigga get near me
I might kiss the baddest bitch if you dare me
I ain't never need a man to take care of me
Yo, I'm in that big boy, bitches can't rent this
I floss every day, but I ain't a dentist
Your whole style and approach I invented

Pretty ladies, are you here? Truffle butter on your pussy
Cuddle buddies on the low
You ain't gotta tell your friend that I eat it in the mornin'
'Cause she gon' say ""I know""
Can I hit it in the bathroom? Put your hands on the toilet
I'll put one leg on the tub, girl
This my new dance move, I just don't know what to call it
But, bitch, you dancin' with the stars
I ain't nothin' like your last dude
What's his name? Not important
I brought some cocaine if you snortin'
She became a vacuum, put it on my dick like carpet
Suck the white off, white chocolate
I'm so heartless, thoughtless, lawless, and flawless
Smallest, regardless, largest in charge
And born in New Orleans, get killed for Jordans

2015,Lay Me Down,Sam Smith,"[Verse 1]
Yes, I do, I believe
That one day I will be where I was
Right there, right next to you
And it's hard, the days just seem so dark
The moon, the stars are nothing without you
Your touch, your skin, where do I begin?
No words can explain the way I'm missing you
Deny this emptiness, this hole that I'm inside
These tears, they tell their own story

[Pre-Chorus]
Told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong

[Chorus]
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you
And make sure you're all right?
I'll take care of you
I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight

Can you hear my call? (Who's to say you won't hear me?)

Lotta people try to tell me I'm the next guy

Chain gang over here, no neck tie
Bitch you know I'm all about the business

2015,Photograph,Ed Sheeran,"[Verse 1]
Lovin' can hurt
Lovin' can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
And when it gets hard
You know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive

[Pre-Chorus]
We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closin'
Hearts are never broken
And time's forever frozen still

[Chorus]
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holdin' me closer till our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
Wait for me to come home

[Verse 2]
Lovin' can heal
Lovin' can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier
Remember that with every piece of ya
Mm, and it's the only thing we take with us when we die

Seven different foreigns, plus she's no hablé
But I make that bitch walk for some cheesecake (Cheesecake)

This Ye, nigga
Shoppin' for the winter and it’s just May, nigga
Ball so hard, man, this shit cray, nigga
And you ain't gettin' money 'less you got eight figures
For that Jesus piece, man, I've been saved, nigga
Just talked to Farrakhan, that's sensei, nigga
Told him I've been on ten since the 10th grade, nigga
Got a middle finger longer than Dikembe, my nigga, uh
I don't let 'em play with me
I don't let 'em talk to me no kind of way
Uh, they better watch what they say to me
Niggas still gettin' popped on the day to day
Yeah, I still got the hundred with the small face, nigga
Might spend 50 racks on my off day, nigga
You a fake Denzel like the Allstate nigga
If you run into me, better have Allstate with yah
You a Rico Suave nigga
Ride 'round listen to Sade, nigga
If you ain't with us, you in our way, nigga
You an actor, you should be on Broadway, nigga
'Cause you do shit the broad way, nigga
Your bitch got a ass, but my broad way thicker
Late for the class, in the hallway, nigga
Yeah, the dropout at it as always, nigga, as always

Niggas lookin' at me like I'm worth both MJs
People saying, ""Ye, Ye, take it easy""
Twenty Gs for the Yeezys off of eBay
Niggas do the most and they ain't done shit
Only way I can sum it up, sumbitch

2015,Old Man,Sawyer Fredericks,"                                        The Barricade

He was abruptly roused from sleep by the noise of a discharge of musketry; and, in spite of Rosanette's entreaties, Frederick was fully determined to go and see what was happening. He hurried down to the Champs-Elysées, from which shots were being fired. At the corner of the Rue Saint-Honoré some men in blouses ran past him, exclaiming:

""No! not that way! to the Palais-Royal!""

Frederick followed them. The grating of the Convent of the Assumption had been torn away. A little further on he noticed three paving-stones in the middle of the street, the beginning of a barricade, no doubt; then fragments of bottles and bundles of iron-wire, to obstruct the cavalry; and, at the same moment, there rushed suddenly out of a lane a tall young man of pale complexion, with his black hair flowing over his shoulders, and with a sort of pea-coloured swaddling-cloth thrown round him. In his hand he held a long military musket, and he dashed along on the tips of his slippers with the air of a somnambulist and with the nimbleness of a tiger. At intervals a detonation could be heard.

On the evening of the day before, the spectacle of the wagon containing five corpses picked up from amongst those that were lying on the Boulevard des Capucines had charged the disposition of the people; and, while at the Tuileries the aides-de-camp succeeded each other, and M. Molé, having set about the composition of a new Cabinet, did not come back, and M. Thiers was making efforts to constitute another, and while the King was cavilling and hesitating, and finally assigned the post of commander-in-chief to Bugeaud in order to prevent him from making use of it, the insurrection was organising itself in a formidable manner, as if it were directed by a single arm.

Men endowed with a kind of frantic eloquence were engaged in haranguing the populace at the street-corners, others were in the churches ringing the tocsin as loudly as ever they could. Lead was cast for bullets, cartridges were rolled about. The trees on the boulevards, the urinals, the benches, the gratings, the gas-burners, everything was torn off and thrown down. Paris, that morning, was covered with barricades. The resistance which was offered was of short duration, so that at eight o'clock the people, by voluntary surrender or by force, had got possession of five barracks, nearly all the municipal buildings, the most favourable strategic points. Of its own accord, without any effort, the Monarchy was melting away in rapid dissolution, and now an attack was made on the guard-house of the Château d'Eau, in order to liberate fifty prisoners, who were not there.

Frederick was forced to stop at the entrance to the square. It was filled with groups of armed men. The Rue Saint-Thomas and the Rue Fromanteau were occupied by companies of the Line. The Rue de Valois was choked up by an enormous barricade. The smoke which fluttered about at the top of it partly opened. Men kept running overhead, making violent gestures; they vanished from sight; then the firing was again renewed. It was answered from the guard-house without anyone being seen inside. Its windows, protected by oaken window-shutters, were pierced with loop-holes; and the monument with its two storys, its two wings, its fountain on the first floor and its little door in the centre, was beginning to be speckled with white spots under the shock of the bullets. The three steps in front of it remained unoccupied.

At Frederick's side a man in a Greek cap, with a cartridge-box over his knitted vest, was holding a dispute with a woman with a Madras neckerchief round her shoulders. She said to him:

""Come back now! Come back!""

""Leave me alone!"" replied the husband. ""You can easily mind the porter's lodge by yourself. I ask, citizen, is this fair? I have on every occasion done my duty—in 1830, in '32, in '34, and in '39! To-day they're fighting again. I must fight! Go away!""

And the porter's wife ended by yielding to his remonstrances and to those of a National Guard near them—a man of forty, whose simple face was adorned with a circle of white beard. He loaded his gun and fired while talking to Frederick, as cool in the midst of the outbreak as a horticulturist in his garden. A young lad with a packing-cloth thrown over him was trying to coax this man to give him a few caps, so that he might make use of a gun he had, a fine fowling-piece which a ""gentleman"" had made him a present of.

""Catch on behind my back,"" said the good man, ""and keep yourself from being seen, or you'll get yourself killed!""

The drums beat for the charge. Sharp cries, hurrahs of triumph burst forth. A continual ebbing to and fro made the multitude sway backward and forward. Frederick, caught between two thick masses of people, did not move an inch, all the time fascinated and exceedingly amused by the scene around him. The wounded who sank to the ground, the dead lying at his feet, did not seem like persons really wounded or really dead. The impression left on his mind was that he was looking on at a show.
In the midst of the surging throng, above the sea of heads, could be seen an old man in a black coat, mounted on a white horse with a velvet saddle. He held in one hand a green bough, in the other a paper, and he kept shaking them persistently; but at length, giving up all hope of obtaining a hearing, he withdrew from the scene.

The soldiers of the Line had gone, and only the municipal troops remained to defend the guard-house. A wave of dauntless spirits dashed up the steps; they were flung down; others came on to replace them, and the gate resounded under blows from iron bars. The municipal guards did not give way. But a wagon, stuffed full of hay, and burning like a gigantic torch, was dragged against the walls. Faggots were speedily brought, then straw, and a barrel of spirits of wine. The fire mounted up to the stones along the wall; the building began to send forth smoke on all sides like the crater of a volcano; and at its summit, between the balustrades of the terrace, huge flames escaped with a harsh noise. The first story of the Palais-Royal was occupied by National Guards. Shots were fired through every window in the square; the bullets whizzed, the water of the fountain, which had burst, was mingled with the blood, forming little pools on the ground. People slipped in the mud over clothes, shakos, and weapons. Frederick felt something soft under his foot. It was the hand of a sergeant in a grey great-coat, lying on his face in the stream that ran along the street. Fresh bands of people were continually coming up, pushing on the combatants at the guard-house. The firing became quicker. The wine-shops were open; people went into them from time to time to smoke a pipe and drink a glass of beer, and then came back again to fight. A lost dog began to howl. This made the people laugh.

Frederick was shaken by the impact of a man falling on his shoulder with a bullet through his back and the death-rattle in his throat. At this shot, perhaps directed against himself, he felt himself stirred up to rage; and he was plunging forward when a National Guard stopped him.

""'Tis useless! the King has just gone! Ah! if you don't believe me, go and see for yourself!""

This assurance calmed Frederick. The Place du Carrousel had a tranquil aspect. The Hôtel de Nantes stood there as fixed as ever; and the houses in the rear; the dome of the Louvre in front, the long gallery of wood at the right, and the waste plot of ground that ran unevenly as far as the sheds of the stall-keepers were, so to speak, steeped in the grey hues of the atmosphere, where indistinct murmurs seemed to mingle with the fog; while, at the opposite side of the square, a stiff light, falling through the parting of the clouds on the façade of the Tuileries, cut out all its windows into white patches. Near the Arc de Triomphe a dead horse lay on the ground. Behind the gratings groups consisting of five or six persons were chatting. The doors leading into the château were open, and the servants at the thresholds allowed the people to enter.

Below stairs, in a kind of little parlour, bowls of café au lait were handed round. A few of those present sat down to the table and made merry; others remained standing, and amongst the latter was a hackney-coachman. He snatched up with both hands a glass vessel full of powdered sugar, cast a restless glance right and left, and then began to eat voraciously, with his nose stuck into the mouth of the vessel.

At the bottom of the great staircase a man was writing his name in a register.

Frederick was able to recognise him by his back.

""Hallo, Hussonnet!""

""Yes, 'tis I,"" replied the Bohemian. ""I am introducing myself at court. This is a nice joke, isn't it?""

""Suppose we go upstairs?""

And they reached presently the Salle des Maréchaux. The portraits of those illustrious generals, save that of Bugeaud, which had been pierced through the stomach, were all intact. They were represented leaning on their sabres with a gun-carriage behind each of them, and in formidable attitudes in contrast with the occasion. A large timepiece proclaimed it was twenty minutes past one.

Suddenly the ""Marseillaise"" resounded. Hussonnet and Frederick bent over the balusters. It was the people. They rushed up the stairs, shaking with a dizzying, wave-like motion bare heads, or helmets, or red caps, or else bayonets or human shoulders with such impetuosity that some people disappeared every now and then in this swarming mass, which was mounting up without a moment's pause, like a river compressed by an equinoctial tide, with a continuous roar under an irresistible impulse. When they got to the top of the stairs, they were scattered, and their chant died away. Nothing could any longer be heard but the tramp of all the shoes intermingled with the chopping sound of many voices. The crowd not being in a mischievous mood, contented themselves with looking about them. But, from time to time, an elbow, by pressing too hard, broke through a pane of glass, or else a vase or a statue rolled from a bracket down on the floor. The wainscotings cracked under the pressure of people against them. Every face was flushed; the perspiration was rolling down their features in large beads. Hussonnet made this remark:
""Heroes have not a good smell.""

""Ah! you are provoking,"" returned Frederick.

And, pushed forward in spite of themselves, they entered an apartment in which a dais of red velvet rose as far as the ceiling. On the throne below sat a representative of the proletariat in effigy with a black beard, his shirt gaping open, a jolly air, and the stupid look of a baboon. Others climbed up the platform to sit in his place.

""What a myth!"" said Hussonnet. ""There you see the sovereign people!""

The armchair was lifted up on the hands of a number of persons and passed across the hall, swaying from one side to the other.

""By Jove, 'tis like a boat! The Ship of State is tossing about in a stormy sea! Let it dance the cancan! Let it dance the cancan!""

They had drawn it towards a window, and in the midst of hisses, they launched it out.

""Poor old chap!"" said Hussonnet, as he saw the effigy falling into the garden, where it was speedily picked up in order to be afterwards carried to the Bastille and burned.

Then a frantic joy burst forth, as if, instead of the throne, a future of boundless happiness had appeared; and the people, less through a spirit of vindictiveness than to assert their right of possession, broke or tore the glasses, the curtains, the lustres, the tapers, the tables, the chairs, the stools, the entire furniture, including the very albums and engravings, and the corbels of the tapestry. Since they had triumphed, they must needs amuse themselves! The common herd ironically wrapped themselves up in laces and cashmeres. Gold fringes were rolled round the sleeves of blouses. Hats with ostriches' feathers adorned blacksmiths' heads, and ribbons of the Legion of Honour supplied waistbands for prostitutes. Each person satisfied his or her caprice; some danced, others drank. In the queen's apartment a woman gave a gloss to her hair with pomatum. Behind a folding-screen two lovers were playing cards. Hussonnet pointed out to Frederick an individual who was smoking a dirty pipe with his elbows resting on a balcony; and the popular frenzy redoubled with a continuous crash of broken porcelain and pieces of crystal, which, as they rebounded, made sounds resembling those produced by the plates of musical glasses.

Then their fury was overshadowed. A nauseous curiosity made them rummage all the dressing-rooms, all the recesses. Returned convicts thrust their arms into the beds in which princesses had slept, and rolled themselves on the top of them, to console themselves for not being able to embrace their owners. Others, with sinister faces, roamed about silently, looking for something to steal, but too great a multitude was there. Through the bays of the doors could be seen in the suite of apartments only the dark mass of people between the gilding of the walls under a cloud of dust. Every breast was panting. The heat became more and more suffocating; and the two friends, afraid of being stifled, seized the opportunity of making their way out.

In the antechamber, standing on a heap of garments, appeared a girl of the town as a statue of Liberty, motionless, her grey eyes wide open—a fearful sight.

They had taken three steps outside the château when a company of the National Guards, in great-coats, advanced towards them, and, taking off their foraging-caps, and, at the same time, uncovering their skulls, which were slightly bald, bowed very low to the people. At this testimony of respect, the ragged victors bridled up. Hussonnet and Frederick were not without experiencing a certain pleasure from it as well as the rest.

They were filled with ardour. They went back to the Palais-Royal. In front of the Rue Fromanteau, soldiers' corpses were heaped up on the straw. They passed close to the dead without a single quiver of emotion, feeling a certain pride in being able to keep their countenance.
The Palais overflowed with people. In the inner courtyard seven piles of wood were flaming. Pianos, chests of drawers, and clocks were hurled out through the windows. Fire-engines sent streams of water up to the roofs. Some vagabonds tried to cut the hose with their sabres. Frederick urged a pupil of the Polytechnic School to interfere. The latter did not understand him, and, moreover, appeared to be an idiot. All around, in the two galleries, the populace, having got possession of the cellars, gave themselves up to a horrible carouse. Wine flowed in streams and wetted people's feet; the mudlarks drank out of the tail-ends of the bottles, and shouted as they staggered along.

""Come away out of this,"" said Hussonnet; ""I am disgusted with the people.""

All over the Orléans Gallery the wounded lay on mattresses on the ground, with purple curtains folded round them as coverlets; and the small shopkeepers' wives and daughters from the quarter brought them broth and linen.

""No matter!"" said Frederick; ""for my part, I consider the people sublime.""

The great vestibule was filled with a whirlwind of furious individuals. Men tried to ascend to the upper storys in order to put the finishing touches to the work of wholesale destruction. National Guards, on the steps, strove to keep them back. The most intrepid was a chasseur, who had his head bare, his hair bristling, and his straps in pieces. His shirt caused a swelling between his trousers and his coat, and he struggled desperately in the midst of the others. Hussonnet, who had sharp sight, recognised Arnoux from a distance.

Then they went into the Tuileries garden, so as to be able to breathe more freely. They sat down on a bench; and they remained for some minutes with their eyes closed, so much stunned that they had not the energy to say a word. The people who were passing came up to them and informed them that the Duchesse d'Orléans had been appointed Regent, and that it was all over. They were experiencing that species of comfort which follows rapid dénouements, when at the windows of the attics in the château appeared men-servants tearing their liveries to pieces. They flung their torn clothes into the garden, as a mark of renunciation. The people hooted at them, and then they retired.

The attention of Frederick and Hussonnet was distracted by a tall fellow who was walking quickly between the trees with a musket on his shoulder. A cartridge-box was pressed against his pea-jacket; a handkerchief was wound round his forehead under his cap. He turned his head to one side. It was Dussardier; and casting himself into their arms:

""Ah! what good fortune, my poor old friends!"" without being able to say another word, so much out of breath was he with fatigue.

He had been on his legs for the last twenty-four hours. He had been engaged at the barricades of the Latin Quarter, had fought in the Rue Rabuteau, had saved three dragoons' lives, had entered the Tuileries with Colonel Dunoyer, and, after that, had repaired to the Chamber, and then to the Hôtel de Ville.

""I have come from it! all goes well! the people are victorious! the workmen and the employers are embracing one another. Ha! if you knew what I have seen! what brave fellows! what a fine sight it was!""

And without noticing that they had no arms:

""I was quite certain of finding you there! This has been a bit rough—no matter!""

A drop of blood ran down his cheek, and in answer to the questions put to him by the two others:

""Oh! 'tis nothing! a slight scratch from a bayonet!""

""However, you really ought to take care of yourself.""

""Pooh! I am substantial! What does this signify? The Republic is proclaimed! We'll be happy henceforth! Some journalists, who were talking just now in front of me, said they were going to liberate Poland and Italy! No more kings! You understand? The entire land free! the entire land free!""

And with one comprehensive glance at the horizon, he spread out his arms in a triumphant attitude. But a long file of men rushed over the terrace on the water's edge.

""Ah, deuce take it! I was forgetting. I must be off. Good-bye!""

He turned round to cry out to them while brandishing his musket:

""Long live the Republic!""

From the chimneys of the château escaped enormous whirlwinds of black smoke which bore sparks along with them. The ringing of the bells sent out over the city a wild and startling alarm. Right and left, in every direction, the conquerors discharged their weapons.

Frederick, though he was not a warrior, felt the Gallic blood leaping in his veins. The magnetism of the public enthusiasm had seized hold of him. He inhaled with a voluptuous delight the stormy atmosphere filled with the odour of gunpowder; and, in the meantime, he quivered under the effluvium of an immense love, a supreme and universal tenderness, as if the heart of all humanity were throbbing in his breast.

Hussonnet said with a yawn:

""It would be time, perhaps, to go and instruct the populace.""

Frederick followed him to his correspondence-office in the Place de la Bourse; and he began to compose for the Troyes newspaper an account of recent events in a lyric style—a veritable tit-bit—to which he attached his signature. Then they dined together at a tavern. Hussonnet was pensive; the eccentricities of the Revolution exceeded his own.

After leaving the café, when they repaired to the Hôtel de Ville to learn the news, the boyish impulses which were natural to him had got the upper hand once more. He scaled the barricades like a chamois, and answered the sentinels with broad jokes of a patriotic flavour.

They heard the Provisional Government proclaimed by torchlight. At last, Frederick got back to his house at midnight, overcome with fatigue.

""Well,"" said he to his man-servant, while the latter was undressing him, ""are you satisfied?""

""Yes, no doubt, Monsieur; but I don't like to see the people dancing to music.""

Next morning, when he awoke, Frederick thought of Deslauriers. He hastened to his friend's lodgings. He ascertained that the advocate had just left Paris, having been appointed a provincial commissioner. At the soirée given the night before, he had got into contact with Ledru-Rollin, and laying siege to him in the name of the Law Schools, had snatched from him a post, a mission. However, the doorkeeper explained, he was going to write and give his address in the following week.

After this, Frederick went to see the Maréchale. She gave him a chilling reception. She resented his desertion of her. Her bitterness disappeared when he had given her repeated assurances that peace was restored.

All was quiet now. There was no reason to be afraid. He kissed her, and she declared herself in favour of the Republic, as his lordship the Archbishop of Paris had already done, and as the magistracy, the Council of State, the Institute, the marshals of France, Changarnier, M. de Falloux, all the Bonapartists, all the Legitimists, and a considerable number of Orléanists were about to do with a swiftness indicative of marvellous zeal.

The fall of the Monarchy had been so rapid that, as soon as the first stupefaction that succeeded it had passed away, there was amongst the middle class a feeling of astonishment at the fact that they were still alive. The summary execution of some thieves, who were shot without a trial, was regarded as an act of signal justice. For a month Lamartine's phrase was repeated with reference to the red flag, ""which had only gone the round of the Champ de Mars, while the tricoloured flag,"" etc.; and all ranged themselves under its shade, each party seeing amongst the three colours only its own, and firmly determined, as soon as it would be the most powerful, to tear away the two others.

As business was suspended, anxiety and love of gaping drove everyone into the open air. The careless style of costume generally adopted attenuated differences of social position. Hatred masked itself; expectations were openly indulged in; the multitude seemed full of good-nature. The pride of having gained their rights shone in the people's faces. They displayed the gaiety of a carnival, the manners of a bivouac. Nothing could be more amusing than the aspect of Paris during the first days that followed the Revolution.

Frederick gave the Maréchale his arm, and they strolled along through the streets together. She was highly diverted by the display of rosettes in every buttonhole, by the banners hung from every window, and the bills of every colour that were posted upon the walls, and threw some money here and there into the collection-boxes for the wounded, which were placed on chairs in the middle of the pathway. Then she stopped before some caricatures representing Louis Philippe as a pastry-cook, as a mountebank, as a dog, or as a leech. But she was a little frightened at the sight of Caussidière's men with their sabres and scarfs. At other times it was a tree of Liberty that was being planted. The clergy vied with each other in blessing the Republic, escorted by servants in gold lace; and the populace thought this very fine. The most frequent spectacle was that of deputations from no matter what, going to demand something at the Hôtel de Ville, for every trade, every industry, was looking to the Government to put a complete end to its wretchedness. Some of them, it is true, went to offer it advice or to congratulate it, or merely to pay it a little visit, and to see the machine performing its functions. One day, about the middle of the month of March, as they were passing the Pont d'Arcole, having to do some commission for Rosanette in the Latin Quarter, Frederick saw approaching a column of individuals with oddly-shaped hats and long beards. At its head, beating a drum, walked a negro who had formerly been an artist's model; and the man who bore the banner, on which this inscription floated in the wind, ""Artist-Painters,"" was no other than Pellerin.

He made a sign to Frederick to wait for him, and then reappeared five minutes afterwards, having some time before him; for the Government was, at that moment, receiving a deputation from the stone-cutters. He was going with his colleagues to ask for the creation of a Forum of Art, a kind of Exchange where the interests of Æsthetics would be discussed. Sublime masterpieces would be produced, inasmuch as the workers would amalgamate their talents. Ere long Paris would be covered with gigantic monuments. He would decorate them. He had even begun a figure of the Republic. One of his comrades had come to take it, for they were closely pursued by the deputation from the poulterers.

""What stupidity!"" growled a voice in the crowd. ""Always some humbug, nothing strong!""

It was Regimbart. He did not salute Frederick, but took advantage of the occasion to give vent to his own bitterness.

The Citizen spent his days wandering about the streets, pulling his moustache, rolling his eyes about, accepting and propagating any dismal news that was communicated to him; and he had only two phrases: ""Take care! we're going to be run over!"" or else, ""Why, confound it! they're juggling with the Republic!"" He was discontented with everything, and especially with the fact that we had not taken back our natural frontiers.

The very name of Lamartine made him shrug his shoulders. He did not consider Ledru-Rollin ""sufficient for the problem,"" referred to Dupont (of the Eure) as an old numbskull, Albert as an idiot, Louis Blanc as an Utopist, and Blanqui as an exceedingly dangerous man; and when Frederick asked him what would be the best thing to do, he replied, pressing his arm till he nearly bruised it:

""To take the Rhine, I tell you! to take the Rhine, damn it!""

Then he blamed the Reactionaries. They were taking off the mask. The sack of the château of Neuilly and Suresne, the fire at Batignolles, the troubles at Lyons, all the excesses and all the grievances, were just now being exaggerated by having superadded to them Ledru-Rollin's circular, the forced currency of bank-notes, the fall of the funds to sixty francs, and, to crown all, as the supreme iniquity, a final blow, a culminating horror, the duty of forty-five centimes! And over and above all these things, there was again Socialism! Although these theories, as new as the game of goose, had been discussed sufficiently for forty years to fill a number of libraries, they terrified the wealthier citizens, as if they had been a hailstorm of aërolites; and they expressed indignation at them by virtue of that hatred which the advent of every idea provokes, simply because it is an idea—an odium from which it derives subsequently its glory, and which causes its enemies to be always beneath it, however lowly it may be.

Then Property rose in their regard to the level of Religion, and was confounded with God. The attacks made on it appeared to them a sacrilege; almost a species of cannibalism. In spite of the most humane legislation that ever existed, the spectre of '93 reappeared, and the chopper of the guillotine vibrated in every syllable of the word ""Republic,"" which did not prevent them from despising it for its weakness. France, no longer feeling herself mistress of the situation, was beginning to shriek with terror, like a blind man without his stick or an infant that had lost its nurse.

Of all Frenchmen, M. Dambreuse was the most alarmed. The new condition of things threatened his fortune, but, more than anything else, it deceived his experience. A system so good! a king so wise! was it possible? The ground was giving way beneath their feet! Next morning he dismissed three of his servants, sold his horses, bought a soft hat to go out into the streets, thought even of letting his beard grow; and he remained at home, prostrated, reading over and over again newspapers most hostile to his own ideas, and plunged into such a gloomy mood that even the jokes about the pipe of Flocon[F] had not the power to make him smile.

As a supporter of the last reign, he was dreading the vengeance of the people so far as concerned his estates in Champagne when Frederick's lucubration fell into his hands. Then it occurred to his mind that his young friend was a very useful personage, and that he might be able, if not to serve him, at least to protect him, so that, one morning, M. Dambreuse presented himself at Frederick's residence, accompanied by Martinon.

This visit, he said, had no object save that of seeing him for a little while, and having a chat with him. In short, he rejoiced at the events that had happened, and with his whole heart adopted ""our sublime motto, Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity,"" having always been at bottom a Republican. If he voted under the other régime with the Ministry, it was simply in order to accelerate an inevitable downfall. He even inveighed against M. Guizot, ""who has got us into a nice hobble, we must admit!"" By way of retaliation, he spoke in an enthusiastic fashion about Lamartine, who had shown himself ""magnificent, upon my word of honour, when, with reference to the red flag——""

""Yes, I know,"" said Frederick. After which he declared that his sympathies were on the side of the working-men.

""For, in fact, more or less, we are all working-men!"" And he carried his impartiality so far as to acknowledge that Proudhon had a certain amount of logic in his views. ""Oh, a great deal of logic, deuce take it!""

Then, with the disinterestedness of a superior mind, he chatted about the exhibition of pictures, at which he had seen Pellerin's work. He considered it original and well-painted.

Martinon backed up all he said with expressions of approval; and likewise was of his opinion that it was necessary to rally boldly to the side of the Republic. And he talked about the husbandman, his father, and assumed the part of the peasant, the man of the people. They soon came to the question of the elections for the National Assembly, and the candidates in the arrondissement of La Fortelle. The Opposition candidate had no chance.

""You should take his place!"" said M. Dambreuse.

Frederick protested.

""But why not?"" For he would obtain the suffrages of the Extremists owing to his personal opinions, and that of the Conservatives on account of his family; ""And perhaps also,"" added the banker, with a smile, ""thanks to my influence, in some measure.""

Frederick urged as an obstacle that he did not know how to set about it.

There was nothing easier if he only got himself recommended to the patriots of the Aube by one of the clubs of the capital. All he had to do was to read out, not a profession of faith such as might be seen every day, but a serious statement of principles.

""Bring it to me; I know what goes down in the locality; and you can, I say again, render great services to the country—to us all—to myself.""

In such times people ought to aid each other, and, if Frederick had need of anything, he or his friends——

""Oh, a thousand thanks, my dear Monsieur!""

""You'll do as much for me in return, mind!""

Decidedly, the banker was a decent man.

Frederick could not refrain from pondering over his advice; and soon he was dazzled by a kind of dizziness.

The great figures of the Convention passed before his mental vision. It seemed to him that a splendid dawn was about to rise. Rome, Vienna and Berlin were in a state of insurrection, and the Austrians had been driven out of Venice. All Europe was agitated. Now was the time to make a plunge into the movement, and perhaps to accelerate it; and then he was fascinated by the costume which it was said the deputies would wear. Already he saw himself in a waistcoat with lapels and a tricoloured sash; and this itching, this hallucination, became so violent that he opened his mind to Dambreuse.

The honest fellow's enthusiasm had not abated.

""Certainly—sure enough! Offer yourself!""

Frederick, nevertheless, consulted Deslauriers.

The idiotic opposition which trammelled the commissioner in his province had augmented his Liberalism. He at once replied, exhorting Frederick with the utmost vehemence to come forward as a candidate. However, as the latter was desirous of having the approval of a great number of persons, he confided the thing to Rosanette one day, when Mademoiselle Vatnaz happened to be present.

She was one of those Parisian spinsters who, every evening when they have given their lessons or tried to sell little sketches, or to dispose of poor manuscripts, return to their own homes with mud on their petticoats, make their own dinner, which they eat by themselves, and then, with their soles resting on a foot-warmer, by the light of a filthy lamp, dream of a love, a family, a hearth, wealth—all that they lack. So it was that, like many others, she had hailed in the Revolution the advent of vengeance, and she delivered herself up to a Socialistic propaganda of the most unbridled description.

The enfranchisement of the proletariat, according to the Vatnaz, was only possible by the enfranchisement of woman. She wished to have her own sex admitted to every kind of employment, to have an enquiry made into the paternity of children, a different code, the abolition, or at least a more intelligent regulation, of marriage. In that case every Frenchwoman would be bound to marry a Frenchman, or to adopt an old man. Nurses and midwives should be officials receiving salaries from the State.

There should be a jury to examine the works of women, special editors for women, a polytechnic school for women, a National Guard for women, everything for women! And, since the Government ignored their rights, they ought to overcome force by force. Ten thousand citizenesses with good guns ought to make the Hôtel de Ville quake!

Frederick's candidature appeared to her favourable for carrying out her ideas. She encouraged him, pointing out the glory that shone on the horizon. Rosanette was delighted at the notion of having a man who would make speeches at the Chamber.

""And then, perhaps, they'll give you a good place?""

Frederick, a man prone to every kind of weakness, was infected by the universal mania. He wrote an address and went to show it to M. Dambreuse.

At the sound made by the great door falling back, a curtain gaped open a little behind a casement, and a woman appeared at it He had not time to find out who she was; but, in the anteroom, a picture arrested his attention—Pellerin's picture—which lay on a chair, no doubt provisionally.

It represented the Republic, or Progress, or Civilisation, under the form of Jesus Christ driving a locomotive, which was passing through a virgin forest. Frederick, after a minute's contemplation, exclaimed:

""What a vile thing!""

""Is it not—eh?"" said M. Dambreuse, coming in unexpectedly just at the moment when the other was giving utterance to this opinion, and fancying that it had reference, not so much to the picture as to the doctrine glorified by the work. Martinon presented himself at the same time. They made their way into the study, and Frederick was drawing a paper out of his pocket, when Mademoiselle Cécile, entering suddenly, said, articulating her words in an ingenuous fashion:

""Is my aunt here?""

""You know well she is not,"" replied the banker. ""No matter! act as if you were at home, Mademoiselle.""

""Oh! thanks! I am going away!""

Scarcely had she left when Martinon seemed to be searching for his handkerchief.

""I forgot to take it out of my great-coat—excuse me!""

""All right!"" said M. Dambreuse.

Evidently he was not deceived by this manœuvre, and even seemed to regard it with favour. Why? But Martinon soon reappeared, and Frederick began reading his address.

At the second page, which pointed towards the preponderance of the financial interests as a disgraceful fact, the banker made a grimace. Then, touching on reforms, Frederick demanded free trade.

""What? Allow me, now!""

The other paid no attention, and went on. He called for a tax on yearly incomes, a progressive tax, a European federation, and the education of the people, the encouragement of the fine arts on the liberal scale.

""When the country could provide men like Delacroix or Hugo with incomes of a hundred thousand francs, where would be the harm?""

At the close of the address advice was given to the upper classes.

""Spare nothing, ye rich; but give! give!""

He stopped, and remained standing. The two who had been listening to him did not utter a word. Martinon opened his eyes wide; M. Dambreuse was quite pale. At last, concealing his emotion under a bitter smile:

""That address of yours is simply perfect!"" And he praised the style exceedingly in order to avoid giving his opinion as to the matter of the address.

This virulence on the part of an inoffensive young man frightened him, especially as a sign of the times.

Martinon tried to reassure him. The Conservative party, in a little while, would certainly be able to take its revenge. In several cities the commissioners of the provisional government had been driven away; the elections were not to occur till the twenty-third of April; there was plenty of time. In short, it was necessary for M. Dambreuse to present himself personally in the Aube; and from that time forth, Martinon no longer left his side, became his secretary, and was as attentive to him as any son could be.

Frederick arrived at Rosanette's house in a very self-complacent mood. Delmar happened to be there, and told him of his intention to stand as a candidate at the Seine elections. In a placard addressed to the people, in which he addressed them in the familiar manner which one adopts towards an individual, the actor boasted of being able to understand them, and of having, in order to save them, got himself ""crucified for the sake of art,"" so that he was the incarnation, the ideal of the popular spirit, believing that he had, in fact, such enormous power over the masses that he proposed by-and-by, when he occupied a ministerial office, to quell any outbreak by himself alone; and, with regard to the means he would employ, he gave this answer: ""Never fear! I'll show them my head!""

Frederick, in order to mortify him, gave him to understand that he was himself a candidate. The mummer, from the moment that his future colleague aspired to represent the province, declared himself his servant, and offered to be his guide to the various clubs.

They visited them, or nearly all, the red and the blue, the furious and the tranquil, the puritanical and the licentious, the mystical and the intemperate, those that had voted for the death of kings, and those in which the frauds in the grocery trade had been denounced; and everywhere the tenants cursed the landlords; the blouse was full of spite against broadcloth; and the rich conspired against the poor. Many wanted indemnities on the ground that they had formerly been martyrs of the police; others appealed for money in order to carry out certain inventions, or else there were plans of phalansteria, projects for cantonal bazaars, systems of public felicity; then, here and there a flash of genius amid these clouds of folly, sudden as splashes, the law formulated by an oath, and flowers of eloquence on the lips of some soldier-boy, with a shoulder-belt strapped over his bare, shirtless chest. Sometimes, too, a gentleman made his appearance—an aristocrat of humble demeanour, talking in a plebeian strain, and with his hands unwashed, so as to make them look hard. A patriot recognised him; the most virtuous mobbed him; and he went off with rage in his soul. On the  pretext of good sense, it was desirable to be always disparaging the advocates, and to make use as often as possible of these expressions: ""To carry his stone to the building,"" ""social problem,"" ""workshop.""

Delmar did not miss the opportunities afforded him for getting in a word; and when he no longer found anything to say, his device was to plant himself in some conspicuous position with one of his arms akimbo and the other in his waistcoat, turning himself round abruptly in profile, so as to give a good view of his head. Then there were outbursts of applause, which came from Mademoiselle Vatnaz at the lower end of the hall.

Frederick, in spite of the weakness of orators, did not dare to try the experiment of speaking. All those people seemed to him too unpolished or too hostile.

But Dussardier made enquiries, and informed him that there existed in the Rue Saint-Jacques a club which bore the name of the ""Club of Intellect."" Such a name gave good reason for hope. Besides, he would bring some friends there.

He brought those whom he had invited to take punch with him—the bookkeeper, the traveller in wines, and the architect; even Pellerin had offered to come, and Hussonnet would probably form one of the party, and on the footpath before the door stood Regimbart, with two individuals, the first of whom was his faithful Compain, a rather thick-set man marked with small-pox and with bloodshot eyes; and the second, an ape-like negro, exceedingly hairy, and whom he knew only in the character of ""a patriot from Barcelona.""

They passed though a passage, and were then introduced into a large room, no doubt used by a joiner, and with walls still fresh and smelling of plaster. Four argand lamps were hanging parallel to each other, and shed an unpleasant light. On a platform, at the end of the room, there was a desk with a bell; underneath it a table, representing the rostrum, and on each side two others, somewhat lower, for the secretaries. The audience that adorned the benches consisted of old painters of daubs, ushers, and literary men who could not get their works published.

In the midst of those lines of paletots with greasy collars could be seen here and there a woman's cap or a workman's linen smock. The bottom of the apartment was even full of workmen, who had in all likelihood come there to pass away an idle hour, and who had been introduced by some speakers in order that they might applaud.

Frederick took care to place himself between Dussardier and Regimbart, who was scarcely seated when he leaned both hands on his walking-stick and his chin on his hands and shut his eyes, whilst at the other end of the room Delmar stood looking down at the assembly. Sénécal appeared at the president's desk.

The worthy bookkeeper thought Frederick would be pleased at this unexpected discovery. It only annoyed him.

The meeting exhibited great respect for the president. He was one who, on the twenty-fifth of February, had desired an immediate organisation of labour. On the following day, at the Prado, he had declared himself in favour attacking the Hôtel de Ville; and, as every person at that period took some model for imitation, one copied Saint-Just, another Danton, another Marat; as for him, he tried to be like Blanqui, who imitated Robespierre. His black gloves, and his hair brushed back, gave him a rigid aspect exceedingly becoming.

He opened the proceedings with the declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen—a customary act of faith. Then, a vigorous voice struck up Béranger's ""Souvenirs du Peuple.""

Other voices were raised:

""No! no! not that!""

""'La Casquette!'"" the patriots at the bottom of the apartment began to howl.

And they sang in chorus the favourite lines of the period:

""Doff your hat before my cap—
Kneel before the working-man!""
At a word from the president the audience became silent.

One of the secretaries proceeded to inspect the letters.

Some young men announced that they burned a number of the Assemblée Nationale every evening in front of the Panthéon, and they urged on all patriots to follow their example.

""Bravo! adopted!"" responded the audience.

The Citizen Jean Jacques Langreneux, a printer in the Rue Dauphin, would like to have a monument raised to the memory of the martyrs of Thermidor.

Michel Evariste Népomucène, ex-professor, gave expression to the wish that the European democracy should adopt unity of language. A dead language might be used for that purpose—as, for example, improved Latin.

""No; no Latin!"" exclaimed the architect.

""Why?"" said the college-usher.

And these two gentlemen engaged in a discussion, in which the others also took part, each putting in a word of his own for effect; and the conversation on this topic soon became so tedious that many went away. But a little old man, who wore at the top of his prodigiously high forehead a pair of green spectacles, asked permission to speak in order to make an important communication.

It was a memorandum on the assessment of taxes. The figures flowed on in a continuous stream, as if they were never going to end. The impatience of the audience found vent at first in murmurs, in whispered talk. He allowed nothing to put him out. Then they began hissing; they catcalled him. Sénécal called the persons who were interrupting to order. The orator went on like a machine. It was necessary to catch him by the shoulder in order to stop him. The old fellow looked as if he were waking out of a dream, and, placidly lifting his spectacles, said:

""Pardon me, citizens! pardon me! I am going—a thousand excuses!""

Frederick was disconcerted with the failure of the old man's attempts to read this written statement. He had his own address in his pocket, but an extemporaneous speech would have been preferable.

Finally the president announced that they were about to pass on to the important matter, the electoral question. They would not discuss the big Republican lists. However, the ""Club of Intellect"" had every right, like every other, to form one, ""with all respect for the pachas of the Hôtel de Ville,"" and the citizens who solicited the popular mandate might set forth their claims.

""Go on, now!"" said Dussardier.

A man in a cassock, with woolly hair and a petulant expression on his face, had already raised his hand. He said, with a stutter, that his name was Ducretot, priest and agriculturist, and that he was the author of a work entitled ""Manures."" He was told to send it to a horticultural club.

Then a patriot in a blouse climbed up into the rostrum. He was a plebeian, with broad shoulders, a big face, very mild-looking, with long black hair. He cast on the assembly an almost voluptuous glance, flung back his head, and, finally, spreading out his arms:

""You have repelled Ducretot, O my brothers! and you have done right; but it was not through irreligion, for we are all religious.""

Many of those present listened open-mouthed, with the air of catechumens and in ecstatic attitudes.

""It is not either because he is a priest, for we, too, are priests! The workman is a priest, just as the founder of Socialism was—the Master of us all, Jesus Christ!""

The time had arrived to inaugurate the Kingdom of God. The Gospel led directly to '89. After the abolition of slavery, the abolition of the proletariat. They had had the age of hate—the age of love was about to begin.

""Christianity is the keystone and the foundation of the new edifice——""

""You are making game of us?"" exclaimed the traveller in wines. ""Who has given me such a priest's cap?""

This interruption gave great offence. Nearly all the audience got on benches, and, shaking their fists, shouted: ""Atheist! aristocrat! low rascal!"" whilst the president's bell kept ringing continuously, and the cries of ""Order! order!"" redoubled. But, aimless, and, moreover, fortified by three cups of coffee which he had swallowed before coming to the meeting, he struggled in the midst of the others:

""What? I an aristocrat? Come, now!""

When, at length, he was permitted to give an explanation, he declared that he would never be at peace with the priests; and, since something had just been said about economical measures, it would be a splendid one to put an end to the churches, the sacred pyxes, and finally all creeds.

Somebody raised the objection that he was going very far.

""Yes! I am going very far! But, when a vessel is caught suddenly in a storm——""

Without waiting for the conclusion of this simile, another made a reply to his observation:

""Granted! But this is to demolish at a single stroke, like a mason devoid of judgment——""

""You are insulting the masons!"" yelled a citizen covered with plaster. And persisting in the belief that provocation had been offered to him, he vomited forth insults, and wished to fight, clinging tightly to the bench whereon he sat. It took no less than three men to put him out.

Meanwhile the workman still remained on the rostrum. The two secretaries gave him an intimation that he should come down. He protested against the injustice done to him.

""You shall not prevent me from crying out, 'Eternal love to our dear France! eternal love all to the Republic!'""

""Citizens!"" said Compain, after this—""Citizens!""

And, by dint of repeating ""Citizens,"" having obtained a little silence, he leaned on the rostrum with his two red hands, which looked like stumps, bent forward his body, and blinking his eyes:

""I believe that it would be necessary to give a larger extension to the calf's head.""

All who heard him kept silent, fancying that they had misunderstood his words.

""Yes! the calf's head!""

Three hundred laughs burst forth at the same time. The ceiling shook.

At the sight of all these faces convulsed with mirth, Compain shrank back. He continued in an angry tone:

""What! you don't know what the calf's head is!""

It was a paroxysm, a delirium. They held their sides. Some of them even tumbled off the benches to the ground with convulsions of laughter. Compain, not being able to stand it any longer, took refuge beside Regimbart, and wanted to drag him away.

""No! I am remaining till 'tis all over!"" said the Citizen.

This reply caused Frederick to make up his mind; and, as he looked about to the right and the left to see whether his friends were prepared to support him, he saw Pellerin on the rostrum in front of him.

The artist assumed a haughty tone in addressing the meeting.

""I would like to get some notion as to who is the candidate amongst all these that represents art. For my part, I have painted a picture.""

""We have nothing to do with painting pictures!"" was the churlish remark of a thin man with red spots on his cheek-bones.

Pellerin protested against this interruption.

But the other, in a tragic tone:

""Ought not the Government to make an ordinance abolishing prostitution and want?""

And this phrase having at once won to his side the popular favour, he thundered against the corruption of great cities.

""Shame and infamy! We ought to catch hold of wealthy citizens on their way out of the Maison d'Or and spit in their faces—unless it be that the Government countenances debauchery! But the collectors of the city dues exhibit towards our daughters and our sisters an amount of indecency——""

A voice exclaimed, some distance away:

""This is blackguard language! Turn him out!""

""They extract taxes from us to pay for licentiousness! Thus, the high salaries paid to actors——""

""Help!"" cried Pellerin.

He leaped from the rostrum, pushed everybody aside, and declaring that he regarded such stupid accusations with disgust, expatiated on the civilising mission of the player. Inasmuch as the theatre was the focus of national education, he would record his vote for the reform of the theatre; and to begin with, no more managements, no more privileges!

""Yes; of any sort!""

The actor's performance excited the audience, and people moved backwards and forwards knocking each other down.

""No more academies! No more institutes!""

""No missions!""

""No more bachelorships! Down with University degrees!""

""Let us preserve them,"" said Sénécal; ""but let them be conferred by universal suffrage, by the people, the only true judge!""

Besides, these things were not the most useful. It was necessary to take a level which would be above the heads of the wealthy. And he represented them as gorging themselves with crimes under their gilded ceilings; while the poor, writhing in their garrets with famine, cultivated every virtue. The applause became so vehement that he interrupted his discourse. For several minutes he remained with his eyes closed, his head thrown back, and, as it were, lulling himself to sleep over the fury which he had aroused.

Then he began to talk in a dogmatic fashion, in phrases as imperious as laws. The State should take possession of the banks and of the insurance offices. Inheritances should be abolished. A social fund should be established for the workers. Many other measures were desirable in the future. For the time being, these would suffice, and, returning to the question of the elections: ""We want pure citizens, men entirely fresh. Let some one offer himself.""

Frederick arose. There was a buzz of approval made by his friends. But Sénécal, assuming the attitude of a Fouquier-Tinville, began to ask questions as to his Christian name and surname, his antecedents, life, and morals.

Frederick answered succinctly, and bit his lips. Sénécal asked whether anyone saw any impediment to this candidature.

""No! no!""

But, for his part, he saw some. All around him bent forward and strained their ears to listen. The citizen who was seeking for their support had not delivered a certain sum promised by him for the foundation of a democratic journal. Moreover, on the twenty-second of February, though he had had sufficient notice on the subject, he had failed to be at the meeting-place in the Place de Panthéon.

""I swear that he was at the Tuileries!"" exclaimed Dussardier.

""Can you swear to having seen him at the Panthéon?""

Dussardier hung down his head. Frederick was silent. His friends, scandalised, regarded him with disquietude.

""In any case,"" Sénécal went on, ""do you know a patriot who will answer to us for your principles?""

""I will!"" said Dussardier.

""Oh! this is not enough; another!""

Frederick turned round to Pellerin. The artist replied to him with a great number of gestures, which meant:

""Ah! my dear boy, they have rejected myself! The deuce! What would you have?""

Thereupon Frederick gave Regimbart a nudge.

""Yes, that's true; 'tis time! I'm going.""

And Regimbart stepped upon the platform; then, pointing towards the Spaniard, who had followed him:

""Allow me, citizens, to present to you a patriot from Barcelona!""

The patriot made a low bow, rolled his gleaming eyes about, and with his hand on his heart:

""Ciudadanos! mucho aprecio el honor that you have bestowed on me! however great may be vuestra bondad, mayor vuestra atención!""

""I claim the right to speak!"" cried Frederick.

""Desde que se proclamo la constitutión de Cadiz, ese pacto fundamental of las libertades Españolas, hasta la ultima revolución, nuestra patria cuenta numerosos y heroicos mártires.""

Frederick once more made an effort to obtain a hearing:

""But, citizens!—--""

The Spaniard went on: ""El martes proximo tendra lugar en la iglesia de la Magdelena un servicio fúnebre.""

""In fact, this is ridiculous! Nobody understands him!""

This observation exasperated the audience.

""Turn him out! Turn him out!""

""Who? I?"" asked Frederick.

""Yourself!"" said Sénécal, majestically. ""Out with you!""

He rose to leave, and the voice of the Iberian pursued him:

""Y todos los Españoles descarien ver alli reunidas las disputaciónes de los clubs y de la milicia nacional. An oración fúnebre en honour of the libertad Española y del mundo entero will be prononciado por un miembro del clero of Paris en la sala Bonne Nouvelle. Honour al pueblo frances que llamaria yo el primero pueblo del mundo, sino fuese ciudadano de otra nación!""

""Aristo!"" screamed one blackguard, shaking his fist at Frederick, as the latter, boiling with indignation, rushed out into the yard adjoining the place where the meeting was held.

He reproached himself for his devotedness, without reflecting that, after all, the accusations brought against him were just.

What fatal idea was this candidature! But what asses! what idiots! He drew comparisons between himself and these men, and soothed his wounded pride with the thought of their stupidity.

Then he felt the need of seeing Rosanette. After such an exhibition of ugly traits, and so much magniloquence, her dainty person would be a source of relaxation. She was aware that he had intended to present himself at a club that evening. However, she did not even ask him a single question when he came in. She was sitting near the fire, ripping open the lining of a dress. He was surprised to find her thus occupied.

""Hallo! what are you doing?""

""You can see for yourself,"" said she, dryly. ""I am mending my clothes! So much for this Republic of yours!""

""Why do you call it mine?""

""Perhaps you want to make out that it's mine!""

And she began to upbraid him for everything that had happened in France for the last two months, accusing him of having brought about the Revolution and with having ruined her prospects by making everybody that had money leave Paris, and that she would by-and-by be dying in a hospital.

""It is easy for you to talk lightly about it, with your yearly income! However, at the rate at which things are going on, you won't have your yearly income long.""

""That may be,"" said Frederick. ""The most devoted are always misunderstood, and if one were not sustained by one's conscience, the brutes that you mix yourself up with would make you feel disgusted with your own self-denial!""

Rosanette gazed at him with knitted brows.

""Eh? What? What self-denial? Monsieur has not succeeded, it would seem? So much the better! It will teach you to make patriotic donations. Oh, don't lie! I know you have given them three hundred francs, for this Republic of yours has to be kept. Well, amuse yourself with it, my good man!""

Under this avalanche of abuse, Frederick passed from his former disappointment to a more painful disillusion.

He withdrew to the lower end of the apartment. She came up to him.

""Look here! Think it out a bit! In a country as in a house, there must be a master, otherwise, everyone pockets something out of the money spent. At first, everybody knows that Ledru-Rollin is head over ears in debt. As for Lamartine, how can you expect a poet to understand politics? Ah! 'tis all very well for you to shake your head and to presume that you have more brains than others; all the same, what I say is true! But you are always cavilling; a person can't get in a word with you! For instance, there's Fournier-Fontaine, who had stores at Saint-Roch! do you know how much he failed for? Eight hundred thousand francs! And Gomer, the packer opposite to him—another Republican, that one—he smashed the tongs on his wife's head, and he drank so much absinthe that he is going to be put into a private asylum. That's the way with the whole of them—the Republicans! A Republic at twenty-five percent. Ah! yes! plume yourself upon it!""

Frederick took himself off. He was disgusted at the foolishness of this girl, which revealed itself all at once in the language of the populace. He felt himself even becoming a little patriotic once more.

The ill-temper of Rosanette only increased. Mademoiselle Vatnaz irritated him with her enthusiasm. Believing that she had a mission, she felt a furious desire to make speeches, to carry on disputes, and—sharper than Rosanette in matters of this sort—overwhelmed her with arguments.

One day she made her appearance burning with indignation against Hussonnet, who had just indulged in some blackguard remarks at the Woman's Club. Rosanette approved of this conduct, declaring even that she would take men's clothes to go and ""give them a bit of her mind, the entire lot of them, and to whip them.""

Frederick entered at the same moment.

""You'll accompany me—won't you?""

And, in spite of his presence, a bickering match took place between them, one of them playing the part of a citizen's wife and the other of a female philosopher.

According to Rosanette, women were born exclusively for love, or in order to bring up children, to be housekeepers.

According to Mademoiselle Vatnaz, women ought to have a position in the Government. In former times, the Gaulish women, and also the Anglo-Saxon women, took part in the legislation; the squaws of the Hurons formed a portion of the Council. The work of civilisation was common to both. It was necessary that all should contribute towards it, and that fraternity should be substituted for egoism, association for individualism, and cultivation on a large scale for minute subdivision of land.

""Come, that is good! you know a great deal about culture just now!""

""Why not? Besides, it is a question of humanity, of its future!""

""Mind your own business!""

""This is my business!""

They got into a passion. Frederick interposed. The Vatnaz became very heated, and went so far as to uphold Communism.

""What nonsense!"" said Rosanette. ""How could such a thing ever come to pass?""

The other brought forward in support of her theory the examples of the Essenes, the Moravian Brethren, the Jesuits of Paraguay, the family of the Pingons near Thiers in Auvergne; and, as she gesticulated a great deal, her gold chain got entangled in her bundle of trinkets, to which was attached a gold ornament in the form of a sheep.

Suddenly, Rosanette turned exceedingly pale.

Mademoiselle Vatnaz continued extricating her trinkets.

""Don't give yourself so much trouble,"" said Rosanette. ""Now, I know your political opinions.""

""What?"" replied the Vatnaz, with a blush on her face like that of a virgin.

""Oh! oh! you understand me.""

Frederick did not understand. There had evidently been something taking place between them of a more important and intimate character than Socialism.

""And even though it should be so,"" said the Vatnaz in reply, rising up unflinchingly. ""'Tis a loan, my dear—set off one debt against the other.""

""Faith, I don't deny my own debts. I owe some thousands of francs—a nice sum. I borrow, at least; I don't rob anyone.""

Mademoiselle Vatnaz made an effort to laugh.

""Oh! I would put my hand in the fire for him.""

""Take care! it is dry enough to burn.""

The spinster held out her right hand to her, and keeping it raised in front of her:

""But there are friends of yours who find it convenient for them.""

""Andalusians, I suppose? as castanets?""

""You beggar!""

The Maréchale made her a low bow.

""There's nobody so charming!""

Mademoiselle Vatnaz made no reply. Beads of perspiration appeared on her temples. Her eyes fixed themselves on the carpet. She panted for breath. At last she reached the door, and slamming it vigorously: ""Good night! You'll hear from me!""

""Much I care!"" said Rosanette. The effort of self-suppression had shattered her nerves. She sank down on the divan, shaking all over, stammering forth words of abuse, shedding tears. Was it this threat on the part of the Vatnaz that had caused so much agitation in her mind? Oh, no! what did she care, indeed, about that one? It was the golden sheep, a present, and in the midst of her tears the name of Delmar escaped her lips. So, then, she was in love with the mummer?

""In that case, why did she take on with me?"" Frederick asked himself. ""How is it that he has come back again? Who compels her to keep me? Where is the sense of this sort of thing?""

Rosanette was still sobbing. She remained all the time stretched at the edge of the divan, with her right cheek resting on her two hands, and she seemed a being so dainty, so free from self-consciousness, and so sorely troubled, that he drew closer to her and softly kissed her on the forehead.

Thereupon she gave him assurances of her affection for him; the Prince had just left her, they would be free. But she was for the time being short of money. ""You saw yourself that this was so, the other day, when I was trying to turn my old linings to use."" No more equipages now! And this was not all; the upholsterer was threatening to resume possession of the bedroom and the large drawing-room furniture. She did not know what to do.

Frederick had a mind to answer:

""Don't annoy yourself about it. I will pay.""

But the lady knew how to lie. Experience had enlightened her. He confined himself to mere expressions of sympathy.

Rosanette's fears were not vain. It was necessary to give up the furniture and to quit the handsome apartment in the Rue Drouot. She took another on the Boulevard Poissonnière, on the fourth floor.

The curiosities of her old boudoir were quite sufficient to give to the three rooms a coquettish air. There were Chinese blinds, a tent on the terrace, and in the drawing-room a second-hand carpet still perfectly new, with ottomans covered with pink silk. Frederick had contributed largely to these purchases. He had felt the joy of a newly-married man who possesses at last a house of his own, a wife of his own—and, being much pleased with the place, he used to sleep there nearly every evening.

One morning, as he was passing out through the anteroom, he saw, on the third floor, on the staircase, the shako of a National Guard who was ascending it. Where in the world was he going?

Frederick waited. The man continued his progress up the stairs, with his head slightly bent down. He raised his eyes. It was my lord Arnoux!

The situation was clear. They both reddened simultaneously, overcome by a feeling of embarrassment common to both.

Arnoux was the first to find a way out of the difficulty.

""She is better—isn't that so?"" as if Rosanette were ill, and he had come to learn how she was.

Frederick took advantage of this opening.

""Yes, certainly! at least, so I was told by her maid,"" wishing to convey that he had not been allowed to see her.

Then they stood facing each other, both undecided as to what they would do next, and eyeing one another intently. The question now was, which of the two was going to remain. Arnoux once more solved the problem.

""Pshaw! I'll come back by-and-by. Where are you going? I go with you!""

And, when they were in the street, he chatted as naturally as usual. Unquestionably he was not a man of jealous disposition, or else he was too good-natured to get angry. Besides, his time was devoted to serving his country. He never left off his uniform now. On the twenty-ninth of March he had defended the offices of the Presse. When the Chamber was invaded, he distinguished himself by his courage, and he was at the banquet given to the National Guard at Amiens.

Hussonnet, who was still on duty with him, availed himself of his flask and his cigars; but, irreverent by nature, he delighted in contradicting him, disparaging the somewhat inaccurate style of the decrees; and decrying the conferences at the Luxembourg, the women known as the ""Vésuviennes,"" the political section bearing the name of ""Tyroliens""; everything, in fact, down to the Car of Agriculture, drawn by horses to the ox-market, and escorted by ill-favoured young girls. Arnoux, on the other hand, was the upholder of authority, and dreamed of uniting the different parties. However, his own affairs had taken an unfavourable turn, and he was more or less anxious about them.

He was not much troubled about Frederick's relations with the Maréchale; for this discovery made him feel justified (in his conscience) in withdrawing the allowance which he had renewed since the Prince had left her. He pleaded by way of excuse for this step the embarrassed condition in which he found himself, uttered many lamentations—and Rosanette was generous. The result was that M. Arnoux regarded himself as the lover who appealed entirely to the heart, an idea that raised him in his own estimation and made him feel young again. Having no doubt that Frederick was paying the Maréchale, he fancied that he was ""playing a nice trick"" on the young man, even called at the house in such a stealthy fashion as to keep the other in ignorance of the fact, and when they happened to meet, left the coast clear for him.

Frederick was not pleased with this partnership, and his rival's politeness seemed only an elaborate piece of sarcasm. But by taking offence at it, he would have removed from his path every opportunity of ever finding his way back to Madame Arnoux; and then, this was the only means whereby he could hear about her movements. The earthenware-dealer, in accordance with his usual practice, or perhaps with some cunning design, recalled her readily in the course of conversation, and asked him why he no longer came to see her.

Frederick, having exhausted every excuse he could frame, assured him that he had called several times to see Madame Arnoux, but without success. Arnoux was convinced that this was so, for he had often referred in an eager tone at home to the absence of their friend, and she had invariably replied that she was out when he called, so that these two lies, in place of contradicting, corroborated each other.

The young man's gentle ways and the pleasure of finding a dupe in him made Arnoux like him all the better. He carried familiarity to its extreme limits, not through disdain, but through assurance. One day he wrote saying that very urgent business compelled him to be away in the country for twenty-four hours. He begged of the young man to mount guard in his stead. Frederick dared not refuse, so he repaired to the guard-house in the Place du Carrousel.

He had to submit to the society of the National Guards, and, with the exception of a sugar-refiner, a witty fellow who drank to an inordinate extent, they all appeared to him more stupid than their cartridge-boxes. The principal subject of conversation amongst them was the substitution of sashes for belts. Others declaimed against the national workshops.

One man said:

""Where are we going?""

The man to whom the words had been addressed opened his eyes as if he were standing on the verge of an abyss.

""Where are we going?""

Then, one who was more daring than the rest exclaimed:

""It cannot last! It must come to an end!""

And as the same kind of talk went on till night, Frederick was bored to death.

Great was his surprise when, at eleven o'clock, he suddenly beheld Arnoux, who immediately explained that he had hurried back to set him at liberty, having disposed of his own business.

The fact was that he had no business to transact. The whole thing was an invention to enable him to spend twenty-four hours alone with Rosanette. But the worthy Arnoux had placed too much confidence in his own powers, so that, now in the state of lassitude which was the result, he was seized with remorse. He had come to thank Frederick, and to invite him to have some supper.

""A thousand thanks! I'm not hungry. All I want is to go to bed.""

""A reason the more for having a snack together. How flabby you are! One does not go home at such an hour as this. It is too late! It would be dangerous!""

Frederick once more yielded. Arnoux was quite a favorite with his brethren-in-arms, who had not expected to see him—and he was a particular crony of the refiner. They were all fond of him, and he was such a good fellow that he was sorry Hussonnet was not there. But he wanted to shut his eyes for one minute, no longer.

""Sit down beside me!"" said he to Frederick, stretching himself on the camp-bed without taking off his belt and straps. Through fear of an alarm, in spite of the regulation, he even kept his gun in his hand, then stammered out some words:

""My darling! my little angel!"" and ere long was fast asleep.

Those who had been talking to each other became silent; and gradually there was a deep silence in the guard-house. Frederick tormented by the fleas, kept staring about him. The wall, painted yellow, had, half-way up, a long shelf, on which the knapsacks formed a succession of little humps, while underneath, the muskets, which had the colour of lead, rose up side by side; and there could be heard a succession of snores, produced by the National Guards, whose stomachs were outlined through the darkness in a confused fashion. On the top of the stove stood an empty bottle and some plates. Three straw chairs were drawn around the table, on which a pack of cards was displayed. A drum, in the middle of the bench, let its strap hang down.

A warm breath of air making its way through the door caused the lamp to smoke. Arnoux slept with his two arms wide apart; and, as his gun was placed in a slightly crooked position, with the butt-end downward, the mouth of the barrel came up right under his arm. Frederick noticed this, and was alarmed.

""But, no, I'm wrong, there's nothing to be afraid of! And yet, suppose he met his death!""

And immediately pictures unrolled themselves before his mind in endless succession.

He saw himself with her at night in a post-chaise, then on a river's bank on a summer's evening, and under the reflection of a lamp at home in their own house. He even fixed his attention on household expenses and domestic arrangements, contemplating, feeling already his happiness between his hands; and in order to realise it, all that was needed was that the cock of the gun should rise. The end of it could be pushed with one's toe, the gun would go off—it would be a mere accident—nothing more!

Frederick brooded over this idea like a playwright in the agonies of composition. Suddenly it seemed to him that it was not far from being carried into practical operation, and that he was going to contribute to that result—that, in fact, he was yearning for it; and then a feeling of absolute terror took possession of him. In the midst of this mental distress he experienced a sense of pleasure, and he allowed himself to sink deeper and deeper into it, with a dreadful consciousness all the time that his scruples were vanishing. In the wildness of his reverie the rest of the world became effaced, and he could only realise that he was still alive from the intolerable oppression on his chest.

""Let us take a drop of white wine!"" said the refiner, as he awoke.

Arnoux sprang to his feet, and, as soon as the white wine was swallowed, he wanted to relieve Frederick of his sentry duty.

Then he brought him to have breakfast in the Rue de Chartres, at Parly's, and as he required to recuperate his energies, he ordered two dishes of meat, a lobster, an omelet with rum, a salad, etc., and finished this off with a brand of Sauterne of 1819 and one of '42 Romanée, not to speak of the champagne at dessert and the liqueurs.

Frederick did not in any way gainsay him. He was disturbed in mind as if by the thought that the other might somehow trace on his countenance the idea that had lately flitted before his imagination. With both elbows on the table and his head bent forward, so that he annoyed Frederick by his fixed stare, he confided some of his hobbies to the young man.

He wanted to take for farming purposes all the embankments on the Northern line, in order to plant potatoes there, or else to organise on the boulevards a monster cavalcade in which the celebrities of the period would figure. He would let all the windows, which would, at the rate of three francs for each person, produce a handsome profit. In short, he dreamed of a great stroke of fortune by means of a monopoly. He assumed a moral tone, nevertheless, found fault with excesses and all sorts of misconduct, spoke about his ""poor father,"" and every evening, as he said, made an examination of his conscience before offering his soul to God.

""A little curaçao, eh?""

""Just as you please.""

As for the Republic, things would right themselves; in fact, he looked on himself as the happiest man on earth; and forgetting himself, he exalted Rosanette's attractive qualities, and even compared her with his wife. It was quite a different thing. You could not imagine a lovelier person!

""Your health!""

Frederick touched glasses with him. He had, out of complaisance, drunk a little too much. Besides, the strong sunlight dazzled him; and when they went up the Rue Vivienne together again, their shoulders touched each other in a fraternal fashion.

When he got home, Frederick slept till seven o'clock. After that he called on the Maréchale. She had gone out with somebody—with Arnoux, perhaps! Not knowing what to do with himself, he continued his promenade along the boulevard, but could not get past the Porte Saint-Martin, owing to the great crowd that blocked the way.

Want had abandoned to their own resources a considerable number of workmen, and they used to come there every evening, no doubt for the purpose of holding a review and awaiting a signal.

In spite of the law against riotous assemblies, these clubs of despair increased to a frightful extent, and many citizens repaired every day to the spot through bravado, and because it was the fashion.

All of a sudden Frederick caught a glimpse, three paces away, of M. Dambreuse along with Martinon. He turned his head away, for M. Dambreuse having got himself nominated as a representative of the people, he cherished a secret spite against him. But the capitalist stopped him.

""One word, my dear monsieur! I have some explanations to make to you.""

""I am not asking you for any.""

""Pray listen to me!""

It was not his fault in any way. Appeals had been made to him; pressure had, to a certain extent, been placed on him. Martinon immediately endorsed all that he had said. Some of the electors of Nogent had presented themselves in a deputation at his house.

""Besides, I expected to be free as soon as——""

A crush of people on the footpath forced M. Dambreuse to get out of the way. A minute after he reappeared, saying to Martinon:

""This is a genuine service, really, and you won't have any reason to regret——""

All three stood with their backs resting against a shop in order to be able to chat more at their ease.

From time to time there was a cry of, ""Long live Napoléon! Long live Barbès! Down with Marie!""

The countless throng kept talking in very loud tones; and all these voices, echoing through the houses, made, so to speak, the continuous ripple of waves in a harbour. At intervals they ceased; and then could be heard voices singing the ""Marseillaise.""

Under the court-gates, men of mysterious aspect offered sword-sticks to those who passed. Sometimes two individuals, one of whom preceded the other, would wink, and then quickly hurry away. The footpaths were filled with groups of staring idlers. A dense crowd swayed to and fro on the pavement. Entire bands of police-officers, emerging from the alleys, had scarcely made their way into the midst of the multitude when they were swallowed up in the mass of people. Little red flags here and there looked like flames. Coachmen, from the place where they sat high up, gesticulated energetically, and then turned to go back. It was a case of perpetual movement—one of the strangest sights that could be conceived.

""How all this,"" said Martinon, ""would have amused Mademoiselle Cécile!""

""My wife, as you are aware, does not like my niece to come with us,"" returned M. Dambreuse with a smile.

One could scarcely recognise in him the same man. For the past three months he had been crying, ""Long live the Republic!"" and he had even voted in favour of the banishment of Orléans. But there should be an end of concessions. He exhibited his rage so far as to carry a tomahawk in his pocket.

Martinon had one, too. The magistracy not being any longer irremovable, he had withdrawn from Parquet, so that he surpassed M. Dambreuse in his display of violence.

The banker had a special antipathy to Lamartine (for having supported Ledru-Rollin) and, at the same time, to Pierre Leroux, Proudhon, Considérant, Lamennais, and all the cranks, all the Socialists.

""For, in fact, what is it they want? The duty on meat and arrest for debt have been abolished. Now the project of a bank for mortgages is under consideration; the other day it was a national bank; and here are five millions in the Budget for the working-men! But luckily, it is over, thanks to Monsieur de Falloux! Good-bye to them! let them go!""

In fact, not knowing how to maintain the three hundred thousand men in the national workshops, the Minister of Public Works had that very day signed an order inviting all citizens between the ages of eighteen and twenty to take service as soldiers, or else to start for the provinces to cultivate the ground there.

They were indignant at the alternative thus put before them, convinced that the object was to destroy the Republic. They were aggrieved by the thought of having to live at a distance from the capital, as if it were a kind of exile. They saw themselves dying of fevers in desolate parts of the country. To many of them, moreover, who had been accustomed to work of a refined description, agriculture seemed a degradation; it was, in short, a mockery, a decisive breach of all the promises which had been made to them. If they offered any resistance, force would be employed against them. They had no doubt of it, and made preparations to anticipate it.

About nine o'clock the riotous assemblies which had formed at the Bastille and at the Châtelet ebbed back towards the boulevard. From the Porte Saint-Denis to the Porte Saint-Martin nothing could be seen save an enormous swarm of people, a single mass of a dark blue shade, nearly black. The men of whom one caught a glimpse all had glowing eyes, pale complexions, faces emaciated with hunger and excited with a sense of wrong.

Meanwhile, some clouds had gathered. The tempestuous sky roused the electricity that was in the people, and they kept whirling about of their own accord with the great swaying movements of a swelling sea, and one felt that there was an incalculable force in the depths of this excited throng, and as it were, the energy of an element. Then they all began exclaiming: ""Lamps! lamps!"" Many windows had no illumination, and stones were flung at the panes. M. Dambreuse deemed it prudent to withdraw from the scene. The two young men accompanied him home. He predicted great disasters. The people might once more invade the Chamber, and on this point he told them how he should have been killed on the fifteenth of May had it not been for the devotion of a National Guard.

""But I had forgotten! he is a friend of yours—your friend the earthenware manufacturer—Jacques Arnoux!"" The rioters had been actually throttling him, when that brave citizen caught him in his arms and put him safely out of their reach.

So it was that, since then, there had been a kind of intimacy between them.

""It would be necessary, one of these days, to dine together, and, since you often see him, give him the assurance that I like him very much. He is an excellent man, and has, in my opinion, been slandered; and he has his wits about him in the morning. My compliments once more! A very good evening!""

Frederick, after he had quitted M. Dambreuse, went back to the Maréchale, and, in a very gloomy fashion, said that she should choose between him and Arnoux. She replied that she did not understand ""dumps of this sort,"" that she did not care about Arnoux, and had no desire to cling to him. Frederick was thirsting to fly from Paris. She did not offer any opposition to this whim; and next morning they set out for Fontainebleau.

The hotel at which they stayed could be distinguished from others by a fountain that rippled in the middle of the courtyard attached to it. The doors of the various apartments opened out on a corridor, as in monasteries. The room assigned to them was large, well-furnished, hung with print, and noiseless, owing to the scarcity of tourists. Alongside the houses, people who had nothing to do kept passing up and down; then, under their windows, when the day was declining, children in the street would engage in a game of base; and this tranquillity, following so soon the tumult they had witnessed in Paris, filled them with astonishment and exercised over them a soothing influence.

Every morning at an early hour, they went to pay a visit to the château. As they passed in through the gate, they had a view of its entire front, with the five pavilions covered with sharp-pointed roofs, and its staircase of horseshoe-shape opening out to the end of the courtyard, which is hemmed in, to right and left, by two main portions of the building further down. On the paved ground lichens blended their colours here and there with the tawny hue of bricks, and the entire appearance of the palace, rust-coloured like old armour, had about it something of the impassiveness of royalty—a sort of warlike, melancholy grandeur.

At last, a man-servant made his appearance with a bunch of keys in his hand. He first showed them the apartments of the queens, the Pope's oratory, the gallery of Francis I., the mahogany table on which the Emperor signed his abdication, and in one of the rooms cut in two the old Galerie des Cerfs, the place where Christine got Monaldeschi assassinated. Rosanette listened to this narrative attentively, then, turning towards Frederick:

""No doubt it was through jealousy? Mind yourself!"" After this they passed through the Council Chamber, the Guards' Room, the Throne Room, and the drawing-room of Louis XIII. The uncurtained windows sent forth a white light. The handles of the window-fastenings and the copper feet of the pier-tables were slightly tarnished with dust. The armchairs were everywhere hidden under coarse linen covers. Above the doors could be seen reliquaries of Louis XIV., and here and there hangings representing the gods of Olympus, Psyche, or the battles of Alexander.

As she was passing in front of the mirrors, Rosanette stopped for a moment to smooth her head-bands.

After passing through the donjon-court and the Saint-Saturnin Chapel, they reached the Festal Hall.

They were dazzled by the magnificence of the ceiling, which was divided into octagonal apartments set off with gold and silver, more finely chiselled than a jewel, and by the vast number of paintings covering the walls, from the immense chimney-piece, where the arms of France were surrounded by crescents and quivers, down to the musicians' gallery, which had been erected at the other end along the entire width of the hall. The ten arched windows were wide open; the sun threw its lustre on the pictures, so that they glowed beneath its rays; the blue sky continued in an endless curve the ultramarine of the arches; and from the depths of the woods, where the lofty summits of the trees filled up the horizon, there seemed to come an echo of flourishes blown by ivory trumpets, and mythological ballets, gathering together under the foliage princesses and nobles disguised as nymphs or fauns—an epoch of ingenuous science, of violent passions, and sumptuous art, when the ideal was to sweep away the world in a vision of the Hesperides, and when the mistresses of kings mingled their glory with the stars. There was a portrait of one of the most beautiful of these celebrated women in the form of Diana the huntress, and even the Infernal Diana, no doubt in order to indicate the power which she possessed even beyond the limits of the tomb. All these symbols confirmed her glory, and there remained about the spot something of her, an indistinct voice, a radiation that stretched out indefinitely. A feeling of mysterious retrospective voluptuousness took possession of Frederick.

In order to divert these passionate longings into another channel, he began to gaze tenderly on Rosanette, and asked her would she not like to have been this woman?

""What woman?""

""Diane de Poitiers!""

He repeated:

""Diane de Poitiers, the mistress of Henry II.""

She gave utterance to a little ""Ah!"" that was all.

Her silence clearly demonstrated that she knew nothing about the matter, and had failed to comprehend his meaning, so that out of complaisance he said to her:

""Perhaps you are getting tired of this?""

""No, no—quite the reverse."" And lifting up her chin, and casting around her a glance of the vaguest description, Rosanette let these words escape her lips:

""It recalls some memories to me!""

Meanwhile, it was easy to trace on her countenance a strained expression, a certain sense of awe; and, as this air of gravity made her look all the prettier, Frederick overlooked it.

The carps' pond amused her more. For a quarter of an hour she kept flinging pieces of bread into the water in order to see the fishes skipping about.

Frederick had seated himself by her side under the linden-trees. He saw in imagination all the personages who had haunted these walls—Charles V., the Valois Kings, Henry IV., Peter the Great, Jean Jacques Rousseau, and ""the fair mourners of the stage-boxes,"" Voltaire, Napoléon, Pius VII., and Louis Philippe; and he felt himself environed, elbowed, by these tumultuous dead people. He was stunned by such a confusion of historic figures, even though he found a certain fascination in contemplating them, nevertheless.

At length they descended into the flower-garden.

It is a vast rectangle, which presents to the spectator, at the first glance, its wide yellow walks, its square grass-plots, its ribbons of box-wood, its yew-trees shaped like pyramids, its low-lying green swards, and its narrow borders, in which thinly-sown flowers make spots on the grey soil. At the end of the garden may be seen a park through whose entire length a canal makes its way.

Royal residences have attached to them a peculiar kind of melancholy, due, no doubt, to their dimensions being much too large for the limited number of guests entertained within them, to the silence which one feels astonished to find in them after so many flourishes of trumpets, to the immobility of their luxurious furniture, which attests by the aspect of age and decay it gradually assumes the transitory character of dynasties, the eternal wretchedness of all things; and this exhalation of the centuries, enervating and funereal, like the perfume of a mummy, makes itself felt even in untutored brains. Rosanette yawned immoderately. They went back to the hotel.

After their breakfast an open carriage came round for them. They started from Fontainebleau at a point where several roads diverged, then went up at a walking pace a gravelly road leading towards a little pine-wood. The trees became larger, and, from time to time, the driver would say, ""This is the Frères Siamois, the Pharamond, the Bouquet de Roi,"" not forgetting a single one of these notable sites, sometimes even drawing up to enable them to admire the scene.

They entered the forest of Franchard. The carriage glided over the grass like a sledge; pigeons which they could not see began cooing. Suddenly, the waiter of a café made his appearance, and they alighted before the railing of a garden in which a number of round tables were placed. Then, passing on the left by the walls of a ruined abbey, they made their way over big boulders of stone, and soon reached the lower part of the gorge.

It is covered on one side with sandstones and juniper-trees tangled together, while on the other side the ground, almost quite bare, slopes towards the hollow of the valley, where a foot-track makes a pale line through the brown heather; and far above could be traced a flat cone-shaped summit with a telegraph-tower behind it.

Half-an-hour later they stepped out of the vehicle once more, in order to climb the heights of Aspremont.

The roads form zigzags between the thick-set pine-trees under rocks with angular faces. All this corner of the forest has a sort of choked-up look—a rather wild and solitary aspect. One thinks of hermits in connection with it—companions of huge stags with fiery crosses between their horns, who were wont to welcome with paternal smiles the good kings of France when they knelt before their grottoes. The warm air was filled with a resinous odour, and roots of trees crossed one another like veins close to the soil. Rosanette slipped over them, grew dejected, and felt inclined to shed tears.

But, at the very top, she became joyous once more on finding, under a roof made of branches, a sort of tavern where carved wood was sold. She drank a bottle of lemonade, and bought a holly-stick; and, without one glance towards the landscape which disclosed itself from the plateau, she entered the Brigands' Cave, with a waiter carrying a torch in front of her. Their carriage was awaiting them in the Bas Breau.

A painter in a blue blouse was working at the foot of an oak-tree with his box of colours on his knees. He raised his head and watched them as they passed.

In the middle of the hill of Chailly, the sudden breaking of a cloud caused them to turn up the hoods of their cloaks. Almost immediately the rain stopped, and the paving-stones of the street glistened under the sun when they were re-entering the town.

Some travellers, who had recently arrived, informed them that a terrible battle had stained Paris with blood. Rosanette and her lover were not surprised. Then everybody left; the hotel became quiet, the gas was put out, and they were lulled to sleep by the murmur of the fountain in the courtyard.

On the following day they went to see the Wolf's Gorge, the Fairies' Pool, the Long Rock, and the Marlotte.[G] Two days later, they began again at random, just as their coachman thought fit to drive them, without asking where they were, and often even neglecting the famous sites.

They felt so comfortable in their old landau, low as a sofa, and covered with a rug made of a striped material which was quite faded. The moats, filled with brushwood, stretched out under their eyes with a gentle, continuous movement. White rays passed like arrows through the tall ferns. Sometimes a road that was no longer used presented itself before them, in a straight line, and here and there might be seen a feeble growth of weeds. In the centre between four cross-roads, a crucifix extended its four arms. In other places, stakes were bending down like dead trees, and little curved paths, which were lost under the leaves, made them feel a longing to pursue them. At the same moment the horse turned round; they  entered there; they plunged into the mire. Further down moss had sprouted out at the sides of the deep ruts.

They believed that they were far away from all other people, quite alone. But suddenly a game-keeper with his gun, or a band of women in rags with big bundles of fagots on their backs, would hurry past them.

When the carriage stopped, there was a universal silence. The only sounds that reached them were the blowing of the horse in the shafts with the faint cry of a bird more than once repeated.

The light at certain points illuminating the outskirts of the wood, left the interior in deep shadow, or else, attenuated in the foreground by a sort of twilight, it exhibited in the background violet vapours, a white radiance. The midday sun, falling directly on wide tracts of greenery, made splashes of light over them, hung gleaming drops of silver from the ends of the branches, streaked the grass with long lines of emeralds, and flung gold spots on the beds of dead leaves. When they let their heads fall back, they could distinguish the sky through the tops of the trees. Some of them, which were enormously high, looked like patriarchs or emperors, or, touching one another at their extremities formed with their long shafts, as it were, triumphal arches; others, sprouting forth obliquely from below, seemed like falling columns. This heap of big vertical lines gaped open. Then, enormous green billows unrolled themselves in unequal embossments as far as the surface of the valleys, towards which advanced the brows of other hills looking down on white plains, which ended by losing themselves in an undefined pale tinge.

Standing side by side, on some rising ground, they felt, as they drank in the air, the pride of a life more free penetrating into the depths of their souls, with a superabundance of energy, a joy which they could not explain.

The variety of trees furnished a spectacle of the most diversified character. The beeches with their smooth white bark twisted their tops together. Ash trees softly curved their bluish branches. In the tufts of the hornbeams rose up holly stiff as bronze. Then came a row of thin birches, bent into elegiac attitudes; and the pine-trees, symmetrical as organ pipes, seemed to be singing a song as they swayed to and fro. There were gigantic oaks with knotted forms, which had been violently shaken, stretched themselves out from the soil and pressed close against each other, and with firm trunks resembling torsos, launched forth to heaven despairing appeals with their bare arms and furious threats, like a group of Titans struck motionless in the midst of their rage. An atmosphere of gloom, a feverish languor, brooded over the pools, whose sheets of water were cut into flakes by the overshadowing thorn-trees. The lichens on their banks, where the wolves come to drink, are of the colour of sulphur, burnt, as it were, by the footprints of witches, and the incessant croaking of the frogs responds to the cawing of the crows as they wheel through the air. After this they passed through the monotonous glades, planted here and there with a staddle. The sound of iron falling with a succession of rapid blows could be heard. On the side of the hill a group of quarrymen were breaking the rocks. These rocks became more and more numerous and finally filled up the entire landscape, cube-shaped like houses, flat like flagstones, propping up, overhanging, and became intermingled with each other, as if they were the ruins, unrecognisable and monstrous, of some vanished city. But the wild chaos they exhibited made one rather dream of volcanoes, of deluges, of great unknown cataclysms. Frederick said they had been there since the beginning of the world, and would remain so till the end. Rosanette turned aside her head, declaring that this would drive her out of her mind, and went off to collect sweet heather. The little violet blossoms, heaped up near one another, formed unequal plates, and the soil, which was giving way underneath, placed soft dark fringes on the sand spangled with mica.

One day they reached a point half-way up a hill, where the soil was full of sand. Its surface, untrodden till now, was streaked so as to resemble symmetrical waves. Here and there, like promontories on the dry bed of an ocean, rose up rocks with the vague outlines of animals, tortoises thrusting forward their heads, crawling seals, hippopotami, and bears. Not a soul around them. Not a single sound. The shingle glowed under the dazzling rays of the sun, and all at once in this vibration of light the specimens of the brute creation that met their gaze began to move about. They returned home quickly, flying from the dizziness that had seized hold of them, almost dismayed.

The gravity of the forest exercised an influence over them, and hours passed in silence, during which, allowing themselves to yield to the lulling effects of springs, they remained as it were sunk in the torpor of a calm intoxication. With his arm around her waist, he listened to her talking while the birds were warbling, noticed with the same glance the black grapes on her bonnet and the juniper-berries, the draperies of her veil, and the spiral forms assumed by the clouds, and when he bent towards her the freshness of her skin mingled with the strong perfume of the woods. They found amusement in everything. They showed one another, as a curiosity, gossamer threads of the Virgin hanging from bushes, holes full of water in the middle of stones, a squirrel on the branches, the way in which two butterflies kept flying after them; or else, at twenty paces from them, under the trees, a hind strode on peacefully, with an air of nobility and gentleness, its doe walking by its side.

Rosanette would have liked to run after it to embrace it.

She got very much alarmed once, when a man suddenly presenting himself, showed her three vipers in a box. She wildly flung herself on Frederick's breast. He felt happy at the thought that she was weak and that he was strong enough to defend her.

That evening they dined at an inn on the banks of the Seine. The table was near the window, Rosanette sitting opposite him, and he contemplated her little well-shaped white nose, her turned-up lips, her bright eyes, the swelling bands of her nut-brown hair, and her pretty oval face. Her dress of raw silk clung to her somewhat drooping shoulders, and her two hands, emerging from their sleeves, joined close together as if they were one—carved, poured out wine, moved over the table-cloth. The waiters placed before them a chicken with its four limbs stretched out, a stew of eels in a dish of pipe-clay, wine that had got spoiled, bread that was too hard, and knives with notches in them. All these things made the repast more enjoyable and strengthened the illusion. They fancied that they were in the middle of a journey in Italy on their honeymoon. Before starting again they went for a walk along the bank of the river.

The soft blue sky, rounded like a dome, leaned at the horizon on the indentations of the woods. On the opposite side, at the end of the meadow, there was a village steeple; and further away, to the left, the roof of a house made a red spot on the river, which wound its way without any apparent motion. Some rushes bent over it, however, and the water lightly shook some poles fixed at its edge in order to hold nets. An osier bow-net and two or three old fishing-boats might be seen there. Near the inn a girl in a straw hat was drawing buckets out of a well. Every time they came up again, Frederick heard the grating sound of the chain with a feeling of inexpressible delight.

He had no doubt that he would be happy till the end of his days, so natural did his felicity appear to him, so much a part of his life, and so intimately associated with this woman's being. He was irresistibly impelled to address her with words of endearment. She answered with pretty little speeches, light taps on the shoulder, displays of tenderness that charmed him by their unexpectedness. He discovered in her quite a new sort of beauty, in fact, which was perhaps only the reflection of surrounding things, unless it happened to bud forth from their hidden potentialities.

When they were lying down in the middle of the field, he would stretch himself out with his head on her lap, under the shelter of her parasol; or else with their faces turned towards the green sward, in the centre of which they rested, they kept gazing towards one another so that their pupils seemed to intermingle, thirsting for one another and ever satiating their thirst, and then with half-closed eyelids they lay side by side without uttering a single word.

Now and then the distant rolling of a drum reached their ears. It was the signal-drum which was being beaten in the different villages calling on people to go and defend Paris.

""Oh! look here! 'tis the rising!"" said Frederick, with a disdainful pity, all this excitement now presenting to his mind a pitiful aspect by the side of their love and of eternal nature.

And they talked about whatever happened to come into their heads, things that were perfectly familiar to them, persons in whom they took no interest, a thousand trifles. She chatted with him about her chambermaid and her hairdresser. One day she was so self-forgetful that she told him her age—twenty-nine years. She was becoming quite an old woman.

Several times, without intending it, she gave him some particulars with reference to her own life. She had been a ""shop girl,"" had taken a trip to England, and had begun studying for the stage; all this she told without any explanation of how these changes had come about; and he found it impossible to reconstruct her entire history.

She related to him more about herself one day when they were seated side by side under a plane-tree at the back of a meadow. At the road-side, further down, a little barefooted girl, standing amid a heap of dust, was making a cow go to pasture. As soon as she caught sight of them she came up to beg, and while with one hand she held up her tattered petticoat, she kept scratching with the other her black hair, which, like a wig of Louis XIV.'s time, curled round her dark face, lighted by a magnificent pair of eyes.

""She will be very pretty by-and-by,"" said Frederick.

""How lucky she is, if she has no mother!"" remarked Rosanette.

""Eh? How is that?""

""Certainly. I, if it were not for mine——""

She sighed, and began to speak about her childhood. Her parents were weavers in the Croix-Rousse. She acted as an apprentice to her father. In vain did the poor man wear himself out with hard work; his wife was continually abusing him, and sold everything for drink. Rosanette could see, as if it were yesterday, the room they occupied with the looms ranged lengthwise against the windows, the pot boiling on the stove, the bed painted like mahogany, a cupboard facing it, and the obscure loft where she used to sleep up to the time when she was fifteen years old. At length a gentleman made his appearance on the scene—a fat man with a face of the colour of boxwood, the manners of a devotee, and a suit of black clothes. Her mother and this man had a conversation together, with the result that three days afterwards—Rosanette stopped, and with a look in which there was as much bitterness as shamelessness:

""It was done!""

Then, in response to a gesture of Frederick.

""As he was married (he would have been afraid of compromising himself in his own house), I was brought to a private room in a restaurant, and told that I would be happy, that I would get a handsome present.

""At the door, the first thing that struck me was a candelabrum of vermilion on a table, on which there were two covers. A mirror on the ceiling showed their reflections, and the blue silk hangings on the walls made the entire apartment resemble an alcove; I was seized with astonishment. You understand—a poor creature who had never seen anything before. In spite of my dazed condition of mind, I got frightened. I wanted to go away. However, I remained.

""The only seat in the room was a sofa close beside the table. It was so soft that it gave way under me. The mouth of the hot-air stove in the middle of the carpet sent out towards me a warm breath, and there I sat without taking anything. The waiter, who was standing near me, urged me to eat. He poured out for me immediately a large glass of wine. My head began to swim, I wanted to open the window. He said to me:

""'No, Mademoiselle! that is forbidden.'""

""And he left me.

""The table was covered with a heap of things that I had no knowledge of. Nothing there seemed to me good. Then I fell back on a pot of jam, and patiently waited. I did not know what prevented him from coming. It was very late—midnight at last—I couldn't bear the fatigue any longer. While pushing aside one of the pillows, in order to hear better, I found under my hand a kind of album—a  book of engravings, they were vulgar pictures. I was sleeping on top of it when he entered the room.""

She hung down her head and remained pensive.

The leaves rustled around them. Amid the tangled grass a great foxglove was swaying to and fro. The sunlight flowed like a wave over the green expanse, and the silence was interrupted at intervals by the browsing of the cow, which they could no longer see.

Rosanette kept her eyes fixed on a particular spot, three paces away from her, her nostrils heaving, and her mind absorbed in thought. Frederick caught hold of her hand.

""How you suffered, poor darling!""

""Yes,"" said she, ""more than you imagine! So much so that I wanted to make an end of it—they had to fish me up!""

""What?""

""Ah! think no more about it! I love you, I am happy! kiss me!""

And she picked off, one by one, the sprigs of the thistles which clung to the hem of her gown.

Frederick was thinking more than all on what she had not told him. What were the means by which she had gradually emerged from wretchedness? To what lover did she owe her education? What had occurred in her life down to the day when he first came to her house? Her latest avowal was a bar to these questions. All he asked her was how she had made Arnoux's acquaintance.

""Through the Vatnaz.""

""Wasn't it you that I once saw with both of them at the Palais-Royal?""

He referred to the exact date. Rosanette made a movement which showed a sense of deep pain.

""Yes, it is true! I was not gay at that time!""

But Arnoux had proved himself a very good fellow. Frederick had no doubt of it. However, their friend was a queer character, full of faults. He took care to recall them. She quite agreed with him on this point.

""Never mind! One likes him, all the same, this camel!""

""Still—even now?"" said Frederick.

She began to redden, half smiling, half angry.

""Oh, no! that's an old story. I don't keep anything hidden from you. Even though it might be so, with him it is different. Besides, I don't think you are nice towards your victim!""

""My victim!""

Rosanette caught hold of his chin.

""No doubt!""

And in the lisping fashion in which nurses talk to babies:

""Have always been so good! Never went a-by-by with his wife?""

""I! never at any time!""

Rosanette smiled. He felt hurt by this smile of hers, which seemed to him a proof of indifference.

But she went on gently, and with one of those looks which seem to appeal for a denial of the truth:

""Are you perfectly certain?""

""Not a doubt of it!""

Frederick solemnly declared on his word of honour that he had never bestowed a thought on Madame Arnoux, as he was too much in love with another woman.

""Why, with you, my beautiful one!""

""Ah! don't laugh at me! You only annoy me!""

He thought it a prudent course to invent a story—to pretend that he was swayed by a passion. He manufactured some circumstantial details. This woman, however, had rendered him very unhappy.

""Decidedly, you have not been lucky,"" said Rosanette.

""Oh! oh! I may have been!"" wishing to convey in this way that he had been often fortunate in his love-affairs, so that she might have a better opinion of him, just as Rosanette did not avow how many lovers she had had, in order that he might have more respect for her—for there will always be found in the midst of the most intimate confidences restrictions, false shame, delicacy, and pity. You divine either in the other or in yourself precipices or miry paths which prevent you from penetrating any farther; moreover, you feel that you will not be understood. It is hard to express accurately the thing you mean, whatever it may be; and this is the reason why perfect unions are rare.

The poor Maréchale had never known one better than this. Often, when she gazed at Frederick, tears came into her eyes; then she would raise them or cast a glance towards the horizon, as if she saw there some bright dawn, perspectives of boundless felicity. At last, she confessed one day to him that she wished to have a mass said, ""so that it might bring a blessing on our love.""

How was it, then, that she had resisted him so long? She could not tell herself. He repeated his question a great many times; and she replied, as she clasped him in her arms:

""It was because I was afraid, my darling, of loving you too well!""

On Sunday morning, Frederick read, amongst the list of the wounded given in a newspaper, the name of Dussardier. He uttered a cry, and showing the paper to Rosanette, declared that he was going to start at once for Paris.

""For what purpose?""

""In order to see him, to nurse him!""

""You are not going, I'm sure, to leave me by myself?""

""Come with me!""

""Ha! to poke my nose in a squabble of that sort? Oh, no, thanks!""

""However, I cannot——""

""Ta! ta! ta! as if they had need of nurses in the hospitals! And then, what concern is he of yours any longer? Everyone for himself!""

He was roused to indignation by this egoism on her part, and he reproached himself for not being in the capital with the others. Such indifference to the misfortunes of the nation had in it something shabby, and only worthy of a small shopkeeper. And now, all of a sudden, his intrigue with Rosanette weighed on his mind as if it were a crime. For an hour they were quite cool towards each other.

Then she appealed to him to wait, and not expose himself to danger.

""Suppose you happen to be killed?""

""Well, I should only have done my duty!""

Rosanette gave a jump. His first duty was to love her; but, no doubt, he did not care about her any longer. There was no common sense in what he was going to do. Good heavens! what an idea!

Frederick rang for his bill. But to get back to Pans was not an easy matter. The Leloir stagecoach had just left; the Lecomte berlins would not be starting; the diligence from Bourbonnais would not be passing till a late hour that night, and perhaps it might be full, one could never tell. When he had lost a great deal of time in making enquiries about the various modes of conveyance, the idea occurred to him to travel post. The master of the post-house refused to supply him with horses, as Frederick had no passport. Finally, he hired an open carriage—the same one in which they had driven about the country—and at about five o'clock they arrived in front of the Hôtel du Commerce at Melun.

The market-place was covered with piles of arms. The prefect had forbidden the National Guards to proceed towards Paris. Those who did not belong to his department wished to go on. There was a great deal of shouting, and the inn was packed with a noisy crowd.

Rosanette, seized with terror, said she would not go a step further, and once more begged of him to stay. The innkeeper and his wife joined in her entreaties. A decent sort of man who happened to be dining there interposed, and observed that the fighting would be over in a very short time. Besides, one ought to do his duty. Thereupon the Maréchale redoubled her sobs. Frederick got exasperated. He handed her his purse, kissed her quickly, and disappeared.

On reaching Corbeil, he learned at the station that the insurgents had cut the rails at regular distances, and the coachman refused to drive him any farther; he said that his horses were ""overspent.""

Through his influence, however, Frederick managed to procure an indifferent cabriolet, which, for the sum of sixty francs, without taking into account the price of a drink for the driver, was to convey him as far as the Italian barrier. But at a hundred paces from the barrier his coachman made him descend and turn back. Frederick was walking along the pathway, when suddenly a sentinel thrust out his bayonet. Four men seized him, exclaiming:

""This is one of them! Look out! Search him! Brigand! scoundrel!""

And he was so thoroughly stupefied that he let himself be dragged to the guard-house of the barrier, at the very point where the Boulevards des Gobelins and de l'Hôpital and Rues Godefroy and Mauffetard converge.

Four barricades formed at the ends of four different ways enormous sloping ramparts of paving-stones. Torches were glimmering here and there. In spite of the rising clouds of dust he could distinguish foot-soldiers of the Line and National Guards, all with their faces blackened, their chests uncovered, and an aspect of wild excitement. They had just captured the square, and had shot down a number of men. Their rage had not yet cooled. Frederick said he had come from Fontainebleau to the relief of a wounded comrade who lodged in the Rue Bellefond. Not one of them would believe him at first. They examined his hands; they even put their noses to his ear to make sure that he did not smell of powder.

However, by dint of repeating the same thing, he finally satisfied a captain, who directed two fusiliers to conduct him to the guard-house of the Jardin des Plantes. They descended the Boulevard de l'Hôpital. A strong breeze was blowing. It restored him to animation.

After this they turned up the Rue du Marché aux Chevaux. The Jardin des Plantes at the right formed a long black mass, whilst at the left the entire front of the Pitié, illuminated at every window, blazed like a conflagration, and shadows passed rapidly over the window-panes.

The two men in charge of Frederick went away. Another accompanied him to the Polytechnic School. The Rue Saint-Victor was quite dark, without a gas-lamp or a light at any window to relieve the gloom. Every ten minutes could be heard the words:

""Sentinels! mind yourselves!""

And this exclamation, cast into the midst of the silence, was prolonged like the repeated striking of a stone against the side of a chasm as it falls through space.

Every now and then the stamp of heavy footsteps could be heard drawing nearer. This was nothing less than a patrol consisting of about a hundred men. From this confused mass escaped whisperings and the dull clanking of iron; and, moving away with a rhythmic swing, it melted into the darkness.

In the middle of the crossing, where several streets met, a dragoon sat motionless on his horse. From time to time an express rider passed at a rapid gallop; then the silence was renewed. Cannons, which were being drawn along the streets, made, on the pavement, a heavy rolling sound that seemed full of menace—a sound different from every ordinary sound—which oppressed the heart. The sounds was profound, unlimited—a black silence. Men in white blouses accosted the soldiers, spoke one or two words to them, and then vanished like phantoms.

The guard-house of the Polytechnic School overflowed with people. The threshold was blocked up with women, who had come to see their sons or their husbands. They were sent on to the Panthéon, which had been transformed into a dead-house; and no attention was paid to Frederick. He pressed forward resolutely, solemnly declaring that his friend Dussardier was waiting for him, that he was at death's door. At last they sent a corporal to accompany him to the top of the Rue Saint-Jacques, to the Mayor's office in the twelfth arrondissement.

The Place du Panthéon was filled with soldiers lying asleep on straw. The day was breaking; the bivouac-fires were extinguished.

The insurrection had left terrible traces in this quarter. The soil of the streets, from one end to the other, was covered with risings of various sizes. On the wrecked barricades had been piled up omnibuses, gas-pipes, and cart-wheels. In certain places there were little dark pools, which must have been blood. The houses were riddled with projectiles, and their framework could be seen under the plaster that was peeled off. Window-blinds, each attached only by a single nail, hung like rags. The staircases having fallen in, doors opened on vacancy. The interiors of rooms could be perceived with their papers in strips. In some instances dainty objects had remained in them quite intact. Frederick noticed a timepiece, a parrot-stick, and some engravings.

When he entered the Mayor's office, the National Guards were chattering without a moment's pause about the deaths of Bréa and Négrier, about the deputy Charbonnel, and about the Archbishop of Paris. He heard them saying that the Duc d'Aumale had landed at Boulogne, that Barbès had fled from Vincennes, that the artillery were coming up from Bourges, and that abundant aid was arriving from the provinces. About three o'clock some one brought good news.

Truce-bearers from the insurgents were in conference with the President of the Assembly.

Thereupon they all made merry; and as he had a dozen francs left, Frederick sent for a dozen bottles of wine, hoping by this means to hasten his deliverance. Suddenly a discharge of musketry was heard. The drinking stopped. They peered with distrustful eyes into the unknown—it might be Henry V.

In order to get rid of responsibility, they took Frederick to the Mayor's office in the eleventh arrondissement, which he was not permitted to leave till nine o'clock in the morning.

He started at a running pace from the Quai Voltaire. At an open window an old man in his shirt-sleeves was crying, with his eyes raised. The Seine glided peacefully along. The sky was of a clear blue; and in the trees round the Tuileries birds were singing.

Frederick was just crossing the Place du Carrousel when a litter happened to be passing by. The soldiers at the guard-house immediately presented arms; and the officer, putting his hand to his shako, said: ""Honour to unfortunate bravery!"" This phrase seemed to have almost become a matter of duty. He who pronounced it appeared to be, on each occasion, filled with profound emotion. A group of people in a state of fierce excitement followed the litter, exclaiming:

""We will avenge you! we will avenge you!""

The vehicles kept moving about on the boulevard, and women were making lint before the doors. Meanwhile, the outbreak had been quelled, or very nearly so. A proclamation from Cavaignac, just posted up, announced the fact. At the top of the Rue Vivienne, a company of the Garde Mobile appeared. Then the citizens uttered cries of enthusiasm. They raised their hats, applauded, danced, wished to embrace them, and to invite them to drink; and flowers, flung by ladies, fell from the balconies.

At last, at ten o'clock, at the moment when the cannon was booming as an attack was being made on the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, Frederick reached the abode of Dussardier. He found the bookkeeper in his garret, lying asleep on his back. From the adjoining apartment a woman came forth with silent tread—Mademoiselle Vatnaz.

She led Frederick aside and explained to him how Dussardier had got wounded.

On Saturday, on the top of a barricade in the Rue Lafayette, a young fellow wrapped in a tricoloured flag cried out to the National Guards: ""Are you going to shoot your brothers?"" As they advanced, Dussardier threw down his gun, pushed away the others, sprang over the barricade, and, with a blow of an old shoe, knocked down the insurgent, from whom he tore the flag. He had afterwards been found under a heap of rubbish with a slug of copper in his thigh. It was found necessary to make an incision in order to extract the projectile. Mademoiselle Vatnaz arrived the same evening, and since then had not quitted his side.

She intelligently prepared everything that was needed for the dressings, assisted him in taking his medicine or other liquids, attended to his slightest wishes, left and returned again with footsteps more light than those of a fly, and gazed at him with eyes full of tenderness.

Frederick, during the two following weeks, did not fail to come back every morning. One day, while he was speaking about the devotion of the Vatnaz, Dussardier shrugged his shoulders:

""Oh! no! she does this through interested motives.""

""Do you think so?""

He replied: ""I am sure of it!"" without seeming disposed to give any further explanation.

She had loaded him with kindnesses, carrying her attentions so far as to bring him the newspapers in which his gallant action was extolled. He even confessed to Frederick that he felt uneasy in his conscience.

Perhaps he ought to have put himself on the other side with the men in blouses; for, indeed, a heap of promises had been made to them which had not been carried out. Those who had vanquished them hated the Republic; and, in the next place, they had treated them very harshly. No doubt they were in the wrong—not quite, however; and the honest fellow was tormented by the thought that he might have fought against the righteous cause. Sénécal, who was immured in the Tuileries, under the terrace at the water's edge, had none of this mental anguish.

There were nine hundred men in the place, huddled together in the midst of filth, without the slightest order, their faces blackened with powder and clotted blood, shivering with ague and breaking out into cries of rage, and those who were brought there to die were not separated from the rest. Sometimes, on hearing the sound of a detonation, they believed that they were all going to be shot. Then they dashed themselves against the walls, and after that fell back again into their places, so much stupefied by suffering that it seemed to them that they were living in a nightmare, a mournful hallucination. The lamp, which hung from the arched roof, looked like a stain of blood, and little green and yellow flames fluttered about, caused by the emanations from the vault. Through fear of epidemics, a commission was appointed. When he had advanced a few steps, the President recoiled, frightened by the stench from the excrements and from the corpses.

As soon as the prisoners drew near a vent-hole, the National Guards who were on sentry, in order to prevent them from shaking the bars of the grating, prodded them indiscriminately with their bayonets.

As a rule they showed no pity. Those who were not beaten wished to signalise themselves. There was a regular outbreak of fear. They avenged themselves at the same time on newspapers, clubs, mobs, speech-making—everything that had exasperated them during the last three months, and in spite of the victory that had been gained, equality (as if for the punishment of its defenders and the exposure of its enemies to ridicule) manifested itself in a triumphal fashion—an equality of brute beasts, a dead level of sanguinary vileness; for the fanaticism of self-interest balanced the madness of want, aristocracy had the same fits of fury as low debauchery, and the cotton cap did not show itself less hideous than the red cap. The public mind was agitated just as it would be after great convulsions of nature. Sensible men were rendered imbeciles for the rest of their lives on account of it.

Père Roque had become very courageous, almost foolhardy. Having arrived on the 26th at Paris with some of the inhabitants of Nogent, instead of going back at the same time with them, he had gone to give his assistance to the National Guard encamped at the Tuileries; and he was quite satisfied to be placed on sentry in front of the terrace at the water's side. There, at any rate, he had these brigands under his feet! He was delighted to find that they were beaten and humiliated, and he could not refrain from uttering invectives against them.

One of them, a young lad with long fair hair, put his face to the bars, and asked for bread. M. Roque ordered him to hold his tongue. But the young man repeated in a mournful tone:

""Bread!""

""Have I any to give you?""

Other prisoners presented themselves at the vent-hole, with their bristling beards, their burning eyeballs, all pushing forward, and yelling:

""Bread!""

Père Roque was indignant at seeing his authority slighted. In order to frighten them he took aim at them; and, borne onward into the vault by the crush that nearly smothered him, the young man, with his head thrown backward, once more exclaimed:

""Bread!""

""Hold on! here it is!"" said Père Roque, firing a shot from his gun. There was a fearful howl—then, silence. At the side of the trough something white could be seen lying.

After this, M. Roque returned to his abode, for he had a house in the Rue Saint-Martin, which he used as a temporary residence; and the injury done to the front of the building during the riots had in no slight degree contributed to excite his rage. It seemed to him, when he next saw it, that he had exaggerated the amount of damage done to it. His recent act had a soothing effect on him, as if it indemnified him for his loss.

It was his daughter herself who opened the door for him. She immediately made the remark that she had felt uneasy at his excessively prolonged absence. She was afraid that he had met with some misfortune—that he had been wounded.

This manifestation of filial love softened Père Roque. He was astonished that she should have set out on a journey without Catherine.

""I sent her out on a message,"" was Louise's reply.

And she made enquiries about his health, about one thing or another; then, with an air of indifference, she asked him whether he had chanced to come across Frederick:

""No; I didn't see him!""

It was on his account alone that she had come up from the country.

Some one was walking at that moment in the lobby.

""Oh! excuse me——""

And she disappeared.

Catherine had not found Frederick. He had been several days away, and his intimate friend, M. Deslauriers, was now living in the provinces.

Louise once more presented herself, shaking all over, without being able to utter a word. She leaned against the furniture.

""What's the matter with you? Tell me—what's the matter with you?"" exclaimed her father.

She indicated by a wave of her hand that it was nothing, and with a great effort of will she regained her composure.

The keeper of the restaurant at the opposite side of the street brought them soup. But Père Roque had passed through too exciting an ordeal to be able to control his emotions. ""He is not likely to die;"" and at dessert he had a sort of fainting fit. A doctor was at once sent for, and he prescribed a potion. Then, when M. Roque was in bed, he asked to be as well wrapped up as possible in order to bring on perspiration. He gasped; he moaned.

""Thanks, my good Catherine! Kiss your poor father, my chicken! Ah! those revolutions!""

And, when his daughter scolded him for having made himself ill by tormenting his mind on her account, he replied:

""Yes! you are right! But I couldn't help it! I am too sensitive!""

noise of a discharge of musketry and in spite of rosanettes entreaties frederick was fully determined to go and see what was happening he hurried down to the champselysées from which shots were being fired at the corner of the rue sainthonoré some men in blouses ran past him exclaiming no not that way to the palaisroyal frederick followed them the grating of the convent of the assumption had been torn away a little further on he noticed three pavingstones in the middle of the street the beginning of a barricade no doubt then fragments of bottles and bundles of ironwire to obstruct the cavalry and at the same moment there rushed suddenly out of a lane a tall young man of pale complexion with his black hair flowing over his shoulders and with a sort of peacoloured swaddlingcloth thrown round him in his hand he held a long military musket and he dashed along on the tips of his slippers with the air of a somnambulist and with the nimbleness of a tiger at intervals a detonation could be heard on the evening of the day before the spectacle of the wagon containing five corpses picked up from amongst those that were lying on the boulevard des capucines had charged the disposition of the people and while at the tuileries the aidesdecamp succeeded each other and m molé having set about the composition of a new cabinet did not come back and m thiers was making efforts to constitute another and while the king was cavilling and hesitating and finally assigned the post of commanderinchief to bugeaud in order to prevent him from making use of it the insurrection was organising itself in a formidable manner as if it were directed by a single arm men endowed with a kind of frantic eloquence were engaged in haranguing the populace at the streetcorners others were in the churches ringing the tocsin as loudly as ever they could lead was cast for bullets cartridges were rolled about the trees on the boulevards the urinals the benches the gratings the gasburners everything was torn off and thrown down paris that morning was covered with barricades the resistance which was offered was of short duration so that at eight oclock the people by voluntary surrender or by force had got possession of five barracks nearly all the municipal buildings the most favourable strategic points of its own accord without any effort the monarchy was melting away in rapid dissolution and now an attack was made on the guardhouse of the château deau in order to liberate fifty prisoners who were not there frederick was forced to stop at the entrance to the square it was filled with groups of armed men the rue saintthomas and the rue fromanteau were occupied by companies of the line the rue de valois was choked up by an enormous barricade the smoke which fluttered about at the top of it partly opened men kept running overhead making violent gestures they vanished from sight then the firing was again renewed it was answered from the guardhouse without anyone being seen inside its windows protected by oaken windowshutters were pierced with loopholes and the monument with its two storys its two wings its fountain on the first floor and its little door in the centre was beginning to be speckled with white spots under the shock of the bullets the three steps in front of it remained unoccupied at fredericks side a man in a greek cap with a cartridgebox over his knitted vest was holding a dispute with a woman with a madras neckerchief round her shoulders she said to him come back now come back leave me alone replied the husband you can easily mind the porters lodge by yourself i ask citizen is this fair i have on every occasion done my duty—in 1830 in 32 in 34 and in 39 today theyre fighting again i must fight go away and the porters wife ended by yielding to his remonstrances and to those of a national guard near them—a man of forty whose simple face was adorned with a circle of white beard he loaded his gun and fired while talking to frederick as cool in the midst of the outbreak as a horticulturist in his garden a young lad with a packingcloth thrown over him was trying to coax this man to give him a few caps so that he might make use of a gun he had a fine fowlingpiece which a gentleman had made him a present of catch on behind my back said the good man and keep yourself from being seen or youll get yourself killed the drums beat for the charge sharp cries hurrahs of triumph burst forth a continual ebbing to and fro made the multitude sway backward and forward frederick caught between two thick masses of people did not move an inch all the time fascinated and exceedingly amused by the scene around him the wounded who sank to the ground the dead lying at his feet did not seem like persons really wounded or really dead the impression left on his mind was that he was looking on at a show in the midst of the surging throng above the sea of heads could be seen an old man in a black coat mounted on a white horse with a velvet saddle he held in one hand a green bough in the other a paper and he kept shaking them persistently but at length giving up all hope of obtaining a hearing he withdrew from the scene the soldiers of the line had gone and only the municipal troops remained to defend the guardhouse a wave of dauntless spirits dashed up the steps they were flung down others came on to replace them and the gate resounded under blows from iron bars the municipal guards did not give way but a wagon stuffed full of hay and burning like a gigantic torch was dragged against the walls faggots were speedily brought then straw and a barrel of spirits of wine the fire mounted up to the stones along the wall the building began to send forth smoke on all sides like the crater of a volcano and at its summit between the balustrades of the terrace huge flames escaped with a harsh noise the first story of the palaisroyal was occupied by national guards shots were fired through every window in the square the bullets whizzed the water of the fountain which had burst was mingled with the blood forming little pools on the ground people slipped in the mud over clothes shakos and weapons frederick felt something soft under his foot it was the hand of a sergeant in a grey greatcoat lying on his face in the stream that ran along the street fresh bands of people were continually coming up pushing on the combatants at the guardhouse the firing became quicker the wineshops were open people went into them from time to time to smoke a pipe and drink a glass of beer and then came back again to fight a lost dog began to howl this made the people laugh frederick was shaken by the impact of a man falling on his shoulder with a bullet through his back and the deathrattle in his throat at this shot perhaps directed against himself he felt himself stirred up to rage and he was plunging forward when a national guard stopped him tis useless the king has just gone ah if you dont believe me go and see for yourself this assurance calmed frederick the place du carrousel had a tranquil aspect the hôtel de nantes stood there as fixed as ever and the houses in the rear the dome of the louvre in front the long gallery of wood at the right and the waste plot of ground that ran unevenly as far as the sheds of the stallkeepers were so to speak steeped in the grey hues of the atmosphere where indistinct murmurs seemed to mingle with the fog while at the opposite side of the square a stiff light falling through the parting of the clouds on the façade of the tuileries cut out all its windows into white patches near the arc de triomphe a dead horse lay on the ground behind the gratings groups consisting of five or six persons were chatting the doors leading into the château were open and the servants at the thresholds allowed the people to enter below stairs in a kind of little parlour bowls of café au lait were handed round a few of those present sat down to the table and made merry others remained standing and amongst the latter was a hackneycoachman he snatched up with both hands a glass vessel full of powdered sugar cast a restless glance right and left and then began to eat voraciously with his nose stuck into the mouth of the vessel at the bottom of the great staircase a man was writing his name in a register frederick was able to recognise him by his back hallo hussonnet yes tis i replied the bohemian i am introducing myself at court this is a nice joke isnt it suppose we go upstairs and they reached presently the salle des maréchaux the portraits of those illustrious generals save that of bugeaud which had been pierced through the stomach were all intact they were represented leaning on their sabres with a guncarriage behind each of them and in formidable attitudes in contrast with the occasion a large timepiece proclaimed it was twenty minutes past one suddenly the marseillaise resounded hussonnet and frederick bent over the balusters it was the people they rushed up the stairs shaking with a dizzying wavelike motion bare heads or helmets or red caps or else bayonets or human shoulders with such impetuosity that some people disappeared every now and then in this swarming mass which was mounting up without a moments pause like a river compressed by an equinoctial tide with a continuous roar under an irresistible impulse when they got to the top of the stairs they were scattered and their chant died away nothing could any longer be heard but the tramp of all the shoes intermingled with the chopping sound of many voices the crowd not being in a mischievous mood contented themselves with looking about them but from time to time an elbow by pressing too hard broke through a pane of glass or else a vase or a statue rolled from a bracket down on the floor the wainscotings cracked under the pressure of people against them every face was flushed the perspiration was rolling down their features in large beads hussonnet made this remark heroes have not a good smell ah you are provoking returned frederick and pushed forward in spite of themselves they entered an apartment in which a dais of red velvet rose as far as the ceiling on the throne below sat a representative of the proletariat in effigy with a black beard his shirt gaping open a jolly air and the stupid look of a baboon others climbed up the platform to sit in his place what a myth said hussonnet there you see the sovereign people the armchair was lifted up on the hands of a number of persons and passed across the hall swaying from one side to the other by jove tis like a boat the ship of state is tossing about in a stormy sea let it dance the cancan let it dance the cancan they had drawn it towards a window and in the midst of hisses they launched it out poor old chap said hussonnet as he saw the effigy falling into the garden where it was speedily picked up in order to be afterwards carried to the bastille and burned then a frantic joy burst forth as if instead of the throne a future of boundless happiness had appeared and the people less through a spirit of vindictiveness than to assert their right of possession broke or tore the glasses the curtains the lustres the tapers the tables the chairs the stools the entire furniture including the very albums and engravings and the corbels of the tapestry since they had triumphed they must needs amuse themselves the common herd ironically wrapped themselves up in laces and cashmeres gold fringes were rolled round the sleeves of blouses hats with ostriches feathers adorned blacksmiths heads and ribbons of the legion of honour supplied waistbands for prostitutes each person satisfied his or her caprice some danced others drank in the queens apartment a woman gave a gloss to her hair with pomatum behind a foldingscreen two lovers were playing cards hussonnet pointed out to frederick an individual who was smoking a dirty pipe with his elbows resting on a balcony and the popular frenzy redoubled with a continuous crash of broken porcelain and pieces of crystal which as they rebounded made sounds resembling those produced by the plates of musical glasses then their fury was overshadowed a nauseous curiosity made them rummage all the dressingrooms all the recesses returned convicts thrust their arms into the beds in which princesses had slept and rolled themselves on the top of them to console themselves for not being able to embrace their owners others with sinister faces roamed about silently looking for something to steal but too great a multitude was there through the bays of the doors could be seen in the suite of apartments only the dark mass of people between the gilding of the walls under a cloud of dust every breast was panting the heat became more and more suffocating and the two friends afraid of being stifled seized the opportunity of making their way out in the antechamber standing on a heap of garments appeared a girl of the town as a statue of liberty motionless her grey eyes wide open—a fearful sight they had taken three steps outside the château when a company of the national guards in greatcoats advanced towards them and taking off their foragingcaps and at the same time uncovering their skulls which were slightly bald bowed very low to the people at this testimony of respect the ragged victors bridled up hussonnet and frederick were not without experiencing a certain pleasure from it as well as the rest they were filled with ardour they went back to the palaisroyal in front of the rue fromanteau soldiers corpses were heaped up on the straw they passed close to the dead without a single quiver of emotion feeling a certain pride in being able to keep their countenance the palais overflowed with people in the inner courtyard seven piles of wood were flaming pianos chests of drawers and clocks were hurled out through the windows fireengines sent streams of water up to the roofs some vagabonds tried to cut the hose with their sabres frederick urged a pupil of the polytechnic school to interfere the latter did not understand him and moreover appeared to be an idiot all around in the two galleries the populace having got possession of the cellars gave themselves up to a horrible carouse wine flowed in streams and wetted peoples feet the mudlarks drank out of the tailends of the bottles and shouted as they staggered along come away out of this said hussonnet i am disgusted with the people all over the orléans gallery the wounded lay on mattresses on the ground with purple curtains folded round them as coverlets and the small shopkeepers wives and daughters from the quarter brought them broth and linen no matter said frederick for my part i consider the people sublime the great vestibule was filled with a whirlwind of furious individuals men tried to ascend to the upper storys in order to put the finishing touches to the work of wholesale destruction national guards on the steps strove to keep them back the most intrepid was a chasseur who had his head bare his hair bristling and his straps in pieces his shirt caused a swelling between his trousers and his coat and he struggled desperately in the midst of the others hussonnet who had sharp sight recognised arnoux from a distance then they went into the tuileries garden so as to be able to breathe more freely they sat down on a bench and they remained for some minutes with their eyes closed so much stunned that they had not the energy to say a word the people who were passing came up to them and informed them that the duchesse dorléans had been appointed regent and that it was all over they were experiencing that species of comfort which follows rapid dénouements when at the windows of the attics in the château appeared menservants tearing their liveries to pieces they flung their torn clothes into the garden as a mark of renunciation the people hooted at them and then they retired the attention of frederick and hussonnet was distracted by a tall fellow who was walking quickly between the trees with a musket on his shoulder a cartridgebox was pressed against his peajacket a handkerchief was wound round his forehead under his cap he turned his head to one side it was dussardier and casting himself into their arms ah what good fortune my poor old friends without being able to say another word so much out of breath was he with fatigue he had been on his legs for the last twentyfour hours he had been engaged at the barricades of the latin quarter had fought in the rue rabuteau had saved three dragoons lives had entered the tuileries with colonel dunoyer and after that had repaired to the chamber and then to the hôtel de ville i have come from it all goes well the people are victorious the workmen and the employers are embracing one another ha if you knew what i have seen what brave fellows what a fine sight it was and without noticing that they had no arms i was quite certain of finding you there this has been a bit rough—no matter a drop of blood ran down his cheek and in answer to the questions put to him by the two others oh tis nothing a slight scratch from a bayonet however you really ought to take care of yourself pooh i am substantial what does this signify the republic is proclaimed well be happy henceforth some journalists who were talking just now in front of me said they were going to liberate poland and italy no more kings you understand the entire land free the entire land free and with one comprehensive glance at the horizon he spread out his arms in a triumphant attitude but a long file of men rushed over the terrace on the waters edge ah deuce take it i was forgetting i must be off goodbye he turned round to cry out to them while brandishing his musket long live the republic from the chimneys of the château escaped enormous whirlwinds of black smoke which bore sparks along with them the ringing of the bells sent out over the city a wild and startling alarm right and left in every direction the conquerors discharged their weapons frederick though he was not a warrior felt the gallic blood leaping in his veins the magnetism of the public enthusiasm had seized hold of him he inhaled with a voluptuous delight the stormy atmosphere filled with the odour of gunpowder and in the meantime he quivered under the effluvium of an immense love a supreme and universal tenderness as if the heart of all humanity were throbbing in his breast hussonnet said with a yawn it would be time perhaps to go and instruct the populace frederick followed him to his correspondenceoffice in the place de la bourse and he began to compose for the troyes newspaper an account of recent events in a lyric style—a veritable titbit—to which he attached his signature then they dined together at a tavern hussonnet was pensive the eccentricities of the revolution exceeded his own after leaving the café when they repaired to the hôtel de ville to learn the news the boyish impulses which were natural to him had got the upper hand once more he scaled the barricades like a chamois and answered the sentinels with broad jokes of a patriotic flavour they heard the provisional government proclaimed by torchlight at last frederick got back to his house at midnight overcome with fatigue well said he to his manservant while the latter was undressing him are you satisfied yes no doubt monsieur but i dont like to see the people dancing to music next morning when he awoke frederick thought of deslauriers he hastened to his friends lodgings he ascertained that the advocate had just left paris having been appointed a provincial commissioner at the soirée given the night before he had got into contact with ledrurollin and laying siege to him in the name of the law schools had snatched from him a post a mission however the doorkeeper explained he was going to write and give his address in the following week after this frederick went to see the maréchale she gave him a chilling reception she resented his desertion of her her bitterness disappeared when he had given her repeated assurances that peace was restored all was quiet now there was no reason to be afraid he kissed her and she declared herself in favour of the republic as his lordship the archbishop of paris had already done and as the magistracy the council of state the institute the marshals of france changarnier m de falloux all the bonapartists all the legitimists and a considerable number of orléanists were about to do with a swiftness indicative of marvellous zeal the fall of the monarchy had been so rapid that as soon as the first stupefaction that succeeded it had passed away there was amongst the middle class a feeling of astonishment at the fact that they were still alive the summary execution of some thieves who were shot without a trial was regarded as an act of signal justice for a month lamartines phrase was repeated with reference to the red flag which had only gone the round of the champ de mars while the tricoloured flag etc and all ranged themselves under its shade each party seeing amongst the three colours only its own and firmly determined as soon as it would be the most powerful to tear away the two others as business was suspended anxiety and love of gaping drove everyone into the open air the careless style of costume generally adopted attenuated differences of social position hatred masked itself expectations were openly indulged in the multitude seemed full of goodnature the pride of having gained their rights shone in the peoples faces they displayed the gaiety of a carnival the manners of a bivouac nothing could be more amusing than the aspect of paris during the first days that followed the revolution frederick gave the maréchale his arm and they strolled along through the streets together she was highly diverted by the display of rosettes in every buttonhole by the banners hung from every window and the bills of every colour that were posted upon the walls and threw some money here and there into the collectionboxes for the wounded which were placed on chairs in the middle of the pathway then she stopped before some caricatures representing louis philippe as a pastrycook as a mountebank as a dog or as a leech but she was a little frightened at the sight of caussidières men with their sabres and scarfs at other times it was a tree of liberty that was being planted the clergy vied with each other in blessing the republic escorted by servants in gold lace and the populace thought this very fine the most frequent spectacle was that of deputations from no matter what going to demand something at the hôtel de ville for every trade every industry was looking to the government to put a complete end to its wretchedness some of them it is true went to offer it advice or to congratulate it or merely to pay it a little visit and to see the machine performing its functions one day about the middle of the month of march as they were passing the pont darcole having to do some commission for rosanette in the latin quarter frederick saw approaching a column of individuals with oddlyshaped hats and long beards at its head beating a drum walked a negro who had formerly been an artists model and the man who bore the banner on which this inscription floated in the wind artistpainters was no other than pellerin he made a sign to frederick to wait for him and then reappeared five minutes afterwards having some time before him for the government was at that moment receiving a deputation from the stonecutters he was going with his colleagues to ask for the creation of a forum of art a kind of exchange where the interests of æsthetics would be discussed sublime masterpieces would be produced inasmuch as the workers would amalgamate their talents ere long paris would be covered with gigantic monuments he would decorate them he had even begun a figure of the republic one of his comrades had come to take it for they were closely pursued by the deputation from the poulterers what stupidity growled a voice in the crowd always some humbug nothing strong it was regimbart he did not salute frederick but took advantage of the occasion to give vent to his own bitterness the citizen spent his days wandering about the streets pulling his moustache rolling his eyes about accepting and propagating any dismal news that was communicated to him and he had only two phrases take care were going to be run over or else why confound it theyre juggling with the republic he was discontented with everything and especially with the fact that we had not taken back our natural frontiers the very name of lamartine made him shrug his shoulders he did not consider ledrurollin sufficient for the problem referred to dupont as an old numbskull albert as an idiot louis blanc as an utopist and blanqui as an exceedingly dangerous man and when frederick asked him what would be the best thing to do he replied pressing his arm till he nearly bruised it to take the rhine i tell you to take the rhine damn it then he blamed the reactionaries they were taking off the mask the sack of the château of neuilly and suresne the fire at batignolles the troubles at lyons all the excesses and all the grievances were just now being exaggerated by having superadded to them ledrurollins circular the forced currency of banknotes the fall of the funds to sixty francs and to crown all as the supreme iniquity a final blow a culminating horror the duty of fortyfive centimes and over and above all these things there was again socialism although these theories as new as the game of goose had been discussed sufficiently for forty years to fill a number of libraries they terrified the wealthier citizens as if they had been a hailstorm of aërolites and they expressed indignation at them by virtue of that hatred which the advent of every idea provokes simply because it is an idea—an odium from which it derives subsequently its glory and which causes its enemies to be always beneath it however lowly it may be then property rose in their regard to the level of religion and was confounded with god the attacks made on it appeared to them a sacrilege almost a species of cannibalism in spite of the most humane legislation that ever existed the spectre of 93 reappeared and the chopper of the guillotine vibrated in every syllable of the word republic which did not prevent them from despising it for its weakness france no longer feeling herself mistress of the situation was beginning to shriek with terror like a blind man without his stick or an infant that had lost its nurse of all frenchmen m dambreuse was the most alarmed the new condition of things threatened his fortune but more than anything else it deceived his experience a system so good a king so wise was it possible the ground was giving way beneath their feet next morning he dismissed three of his servants sold his horses bought a soft hat to go out into the streets thought even of letting his beard grow and he remained at home prostrated reading over and over again newspapers most hostile to his own ideas and plunged into such a gloomy mood that even the jokes about the pipe of flocon had not the power to make him smile as a supporter of the last reign he was dreading the vengeance of the people so far as concerned his estates in champagne when fredericks lucubration fell into his hands then it occurred to his mind that his young friend was a very useful personage and that he might be able if not to serve him at least to protect him so that one morning m dambreuse presented himself at fredericks residence accompanied by martinon this visit he said had no object save that of seeing him for a little while and having a chat with him in short he rejoiced at the events that had happened and with his whole heart adopted our sublime motto liberty equality and fraternity having always been at bottom a republican if he voted under the other régime with the ministry it was simply in order to accelerate an inevitable downfall he even inveighed against m guizot who has got us into a nice hobble we must admit by way of retaliation he spoke in an enthusiastic fashion about lamartine who had shown himself magnificent upon my word of honour when with reference to the red flag—— yes i know said frederick after which he declared that his sympathies were on the side of the workingmen for in fact more or less we are all workingmen and he carried his impartiality so far as to acknowledge that proudhon had a certain amount of logic in his views oh a great deal of logic deuce take it then with the disinterestedness of a superior mind he chatted about the exhibition of pictures at which he had seen pellerins work he considered it original and wellpainted martinon backed up all he said with expressions of approval and likewise was of his opinion that it was necessary to rally boldly to the side of the republic and he talked about the husbandman his father and assumed the part of the peasant the man of the people they soon came to the question of the elections for the national assembly and the candidates in the arrondissement of la fortelle the opposition candidate had no chance you should take his place said m dambreuse frederick protested but why not for he would obtain the suffrages of the extremists owing to his personal opinions and that of the conservatives on account of his family and perhaps also added the banker with a smile thanks to my influence in some measure frederick urged as an obstacle that he did not know how to set about it there was nothing easier if he only got himself recommended to the patriots of the aube by one of the clubs of the capital all he had to do was to read out not a profession of faith such as might be seen every day but a serious statement of principles bring it to me i know what goes down in the locality and you can i say again render great services to the country—to us all—to myself in such times people ought to aid each other and if frederick had need of anything he or his friends—— oh a thousand thanks my dear monsieur youll do as much for me in return mind decidedly the banker was a decent man frederick could not refrain from pondering over his advice and soon he was dazzled by a kind of dizziness the great figures of the convention passed before his mental vision it seemed to him that a splendid dawn was about to rise rome vienna and berlin were in a state of insurrection and the austrians had been driven out of venice all europe was agitated now was the time to make a plunge into the movement and perhaps to accelerate it and then he was fascinated by the costume which it was said the deputies would wear already he saw himself in a waistcoat with lapels and a tricoloured sash and this itching this hallucination became so violent that he opened his mind to dambreuse the honest fellows enthusiasm had not abated certainly—sure enough offer yourself frederick nevertheless consulted deslauriers the idiotic opposition which trammelled the commissioner in his province had augmented his liberalism he at once replied exhorting frederick with the utmost vehemence to come forward as a candidate however as the latter was desirous of having the approval of a great number of persons he confided the thing to rosanette one day when mademoiselle vatnaz happened to be present she was one of those parisian spinsters who every evening when they have given their lessons or tried to sell little sketches or to dispose of poor manuscripts return to their own homes with mud on their petticoats make their own dinner which they eat by themselves and then with their soles resting on a footwarmer by the light of a filthy lamp dream of a love a family a hearth wealth—all that they lack so it was that like many others she had hailed in the revolution the advent of vengeance and she delivered herself up to a socialistic propaganda of the most unbridled description the enfranchisement of the proletariat according to the vatnaz was only possible by the enfranchisement of woman she wished to have her own sex admitted to every kind of employment to have an enquiry made into the paternity of children a different code the abolition or at least a more intelligent regulation of marriage in that case every frenchwoman would be bound to marry a frenchman or to adopt an old man nurses and midwives should be officials receiving salaries from the state there should be a jury to examine the works of women special editors for women a polytechnic school for women a national guard for women everything for women and since the government ignored their rights they ought to overcome force by force ten thousand citizenesses with good guns ought to make the hôtel de ville quake fredericks candidature appeared to her favourable for carrying out her ideas she encouraged him pointing out the glory that shone on the horizon rosanette was delighted at the notion of having a man who would make speeches at the chamber and then perhaps theyll give you a good place frederick a man prone to every kind of weakness was infected by the universal mania he wrote an address and went to show it to m dambreuse at the sound made by the great door falling back a curtain gaped open a little behind a casement and a woman appeared at it he had not time to find out who she was but in the anteroom a picture arrested his attention—pellerins picture—which lay on a chair no doubt provisionally it represented the republic or progress or civilisation under the form of jesus christ driving a locomotive which was passing through a virgin forest frederick after a minutes contemplation exclaimed what a vile thing is it not—eh said m dambreuse coming in unexpectedly just at the moment when the other was giving utterance to this opinion and fancying that it had reference not so much to the picture as to the doctrine glorified by the work martinon presented himself at the same time they made their way into the study and frederick was drawing a paper out of his pocket when mademoiselle cécile entering suddenly said articulating her words in an ingenuous fashion is my aunt here you know well she is not replied the banker no matter act as if you were at home mademoiselle oh thanks i am going away scarcely had she left when martinon seemed to be searching for his handkerchief i forgot to take it out of my greatcoat—excuse me all right said m dambreuse evidently he was not deceived by this manœuvre and even seemed to regard it with favour why but martinon soon reappeared and frederick began reading his address at the second page which pointed towards the preponderance of the financial interests as a disgraceful fact the banker made a grimace then touching on reforms frederick demanded free trade what allow me now the other paid no attention and went on he called for a tax on yearly incomes a progressive tax a european federation and the education of the people the encouragement of the fine arts on the liberal scale when the country could provide men like delacroix or hugo with incomes of a hundred thousand francs where would be the harm at the close of the address advice was given to the upper classes spare nothing ye rich but give give he stopped and remained standing the two who had been listening to him did not utter a word martinon opened his eyes wide m dambreuse was quite pale at last concealing his emotion under a bitter smile that address of yours is simply perfect and he praised the style exceedingly in order to avoid giving his opinion as to the matter of the address this virulence on the part of an inoffensive young man frightened him especially as a sign of the times martinon tried to reassure him the conservative party in a little while would certainly be able to take its revenge in several cities the commissioners of the provisional government had been driven away the elections were not to occur till the twentythird of april there was plenty of time in short it was necessary for m dambreuse to present himself personally in the aube and from that time forth martinon no longer left his side became his secretary and was as attentive to him as any son could be frederick arrived at rosanettes house in a very selfcomplacent mood delmar happened to be there and told him of his intention to stand as a candidate at the seine elections in a placard addressed to the people in which he addressed them in the familiar manner which one adopts towards an individual the actor boasted of being able to understand them and of having in order to save them got himself crucified for the sake of art so that he was the incarnation the ideal of the popular spirit believing that he had in fact such enormous power over the masses that he proposed byandby when he occupied a ministerial office to quell any outbreak by himself alone and with regard to the means he would employ he gave this answer never fear ill show them my head frederick in order to mortify him gave him to understand that he was himself a candidate the mummer from the moment that his future colleague aspired to represent the province declared himself his servant and offered to be his guide to the various clubs they visited them or nearly all the red and the blue the furious and the tranquil the puritanical and the licentious the mystical and the intemperate those that had voted for the death of kings and those in which the frauds in the grocery trade had been denounced and everywhere the tenants cursed the landlords the blouse was full of spite against broadcloth and the rich conspired against the poor many wanted indemnities on the ground that they had formerly been martyrs of the police others appealed for money in order to carry out certain inventions or else there were plans of phalansteria projects for cantonal bazaars systems of public felicity then here and there a flash of genius amid these clouds of folly sudden as splashes the law formulated by an oath and flowers of eloquence on the lips of some soldierboy with a shoulderbelt strapped over his bare shirtless chest sometimes too a gentleman made his appearance—an aristocrat of humble demeanour talking in a plebeian strain and with his hands unwashed so as to make them look hard a patriot recognised him the most virtuous mobbed him and he went off with rage in his soul on the pretext of good sense it was desirable to be always disparaging the advocates and to make use as often as possible of these expressions to carry his stone to the building social problem workshop delmar did not miss the opportunities afforded him for getting in a word and when he no longer found anything to say his device was to plant himself in some conspicuous position with one of his arms akimbo and the other in his waistcoat turning himself round abruptly in profile so as to give a good view of his head then there were outbursts of applause which came from mademoiselle vatnaz at the lower end of the hall frederick in spite of the weakness of orators did not dare to try the experiment of speaking all those people seemed to him too unpolished or too hostile but dussardier made enquiries and informed him that there existed in the rue saintjacques a club which bore the name of the club of intellect such a name gave good reason for hope besides he would bring some friends there he brought those whom he had invited to take punch with him—the bookkeeper the traveller in wines and the architect even pellerin had offered to come and hussonnet would probably form one of the party and on the footpath before the door stood regimbart with two individuals the first of whom was his faithful compain a rather thickset man marked with smallpox and with bloodshot eyes and the second an apelike negro exceedingly hairy and whom he knew only in the character of a patriot from barcelona they passed though a passage and were then introduced into a large room no doubt used by a joiner and with walls still fresh and smelling of plaster four argand lamps were hanging parallel to each other and shed an unpleasant light on a platform at the end of the room there was a desk with a bell underneath it a table representing the rostrum and on each side two others somewhat lower for the secretaries the audience that adorned the benches consisted of old painters of daubs ushers and literary men who could not get their works published in the midst of those lines of paletots with greasy collars could be seen here and there a womans cap or a workmans linen smock the bottom of the apartment was even full of workmen who had in all likelihood come there to pass away an idle hour and who had been introduced by some speakers in order that they might applaud frederick took care to place himself between dussardier and regimbart who was scarcely seated when he leaned both hands on his walkingstick and his chin on his hands and shut his eyes whilst at the other end of the room delmar stood looking down at the assembly sénécal appeared at the presidents desk the worthy bookkeeper thought frederick would be pleased at this unexpected discovery it only annoyed him the meeting exhibited great respect for the president he was one who on the twentyfifth of february had desired an immediate organisation of labour on the following day at the prado he had declared himself in favour attacking the hôtel de ville and as every person at that period took some model for imitation one copied saintjust another danton another marat as for him he tried to be like blanqui who imitated robespierre his black gloves and his hair brushed back gave him a rigid aspect exceedingly becoming he opened the proceedings with the declaration of the rights of man and of the citizen—a customary act of faith then a vigorous voice struck up bérangers souvenirs du peuple other voices were raised no no not that la casquette the patriots at the bottom of the apartment began to howl and they sang in chorus the favourite lines of the period doff your hat before my cap— kneel before the workingman at a word from the president the audience became silent one of the secretaries proceeded to inspect the letters some young men announced that they burned a number of the assemblée nationale every evening in front of the panthéon and they urged on all patriots to follow their example bravo adopted responded the audience the citizen jean jacques langreneux a printer in the rue dauphin would like to have a monument raised to the memory of the martyrs of thermidor michel evariste népomucène exprofessor gave expression to the wish that the european democracy should adopt unity of language a dead language might be used for that purpose—as for example improved latin no no latin exclaimed the architect why said the collegeusher and these two gentlemen engaged in a discussion in which the others also took part each putting in a word of his own for effect and the conversation on this topic soon became so tedious that many went away but a little old man who wore at the top of his prodigiously high forehead a pair of green spectacles asked permission to speak in order to make an important communication it was a memorandum on the assessment of taxes the figures flowed on in a continuous stream as if they were never going to end the impatience of the audience found vent at first in murmurs in whispered talk he allowed nothing to put him out then they began hissing they catcalled him sénécal called the persons who were interrupting to order the orator went on like a machine it was necessary to catch him by the shoulder in order to stop him the old fellow looked as if he were waking out of a dream and placidly lifting his spectacles said pardon me citizens pardon me i am going—a thousand excuses frederick was disconcerted with the failure of the old mans attempts to read this written statement he had his own address in his pocket but an extemporaneous speech would have been preferable finally the president announced that they were about to pass on to the important matter the electoral question they would not discuss the big republican lists however the club of intellect had every right like every other to form one with all respect for the pachas of the hôtel de ville and the citizens who solicited the popular mandate might set forth their claims go on now said dussardier a man in a cassock with woolly hair and a petulant expression on his face had already raised his hand he said with a stutter that his name was ducretot priest and agriculturist and that he was the author of a work entitled manures he was told to send it to a horticultural club then a patriot in a blouse climbed up into the rostrum he was a plebeian with broad shoulders a big face very mildlooking with long black hair he cast on the assembly an almost voluptuous glance flung back his head and finally spreading out his arms you have repelled ducretot o my brothers and you have done right but it was not through irreligion for we are all religious many of those present listened openmouthed with the air of catechumens and in ecstatic attitudes it is not either because he is a priest for we too are priests the workman is a priest just as the founder of socialism was—the master of us all jesus christ the time had arrived to inaugurate the kingdom of god the gospel led directly to 89 after the abolition of slavery the abolition of the proletariat they had had the age of hate—the age of love was about to begin christianity is the keystone and the foundation of the new edifice—— you are making game of us exclaimed the traveller in wines who has given me such a priests cap this interruption gave great offence nearly all the audience got on benches and shaking their fists shouted atheist aristocrat low rascal whilst the presidents bell kept ringing continuously and the cries of order order redoubled but aimless and moreover fortified by three cups of coffee which he had swallowed before coming to the meeting he struggled in the midst of the others what i an aristocrat come now when at length he was permitted to give an explanation he declared that he would never be at peace with the priests and since something had just been said about economical measures it would be a splendid one to put an end to the churches the sacred pyxes and finally all creeds somebody raised the objection that he was going very far yes i am going very far but when a vessel is caught suddenly in a storm—— without waiting for the conclusion of this simile another made a reply to his observation granted but this is to demolish at a single stroke like a mason devoid of judgment—— you are insulting the masons yelled a citizen covered with plaster and persisting in the belief that provocation had been offered to him he vomited forth insults and wished to fight clinging tightly to the bench whereon he sat it took no less than three men to put him out meanwhile the workman still remained on the rostrum the two secretaries gave him an intimation that he should come down he protested against the injustice done to him you shall not prevent me from crying out eternal love to our dear france eternal love all to the republic citizens said compain after this—citizens and by dint of repeating citizens having obtained a little silence he leaned on the rostrum with his two red hands which looked like stumps bent forward his body and blinking his eyes i believe that it would be necessary to give a larger extension to the calfs head all who heard him kept silent fancying that they had misunderstood his words yes the calfs head three hundred laughs burst forth at the same time the ceiling shook at the sight of all these faces convulsed with mirth compain shrank back he continued in an angry tone what you dont know what the calfs head is it was a paroxysm a delirium they held their sides some of them even tumbled off the benches to the ground with convulsions of laughter compain not being able to stand it any longer took refuge beside regimbart and wanted to drag him away no i am remaining till tis all over said the citizen this reply caused frederick to make up his mind and as he looked about to the right and the left to see whether his friends were prepared to support him he saw pellerin on the rostrum in front of him the artist assumed a haughty tone in addressing the meeting i would like to get some notion as to who is the candidate amongst all these that represents art for my part i have painted a picture we have nothing to do with painting pictures was the churlish remark of a thin man with red spots on his cheekbones pellerin protested against this interruption but the other in a tragic tone ought not the government to make an ordinance abolishing prostitution and want and this phrase having at once won to his side the popular favour he thundered against the corruption of great cities shame and infamy we ought to catch hold of wealthy citizens on their way out of the maison dor and spit in their faces—unless it be that the government countenances debauchery but the collectors of the city dues exhibit towards our daughters and our sisters an amount of indecency—— a voice exclaimed some distance away this is blackguard language turn him out they extract taxes from us to pay for licentiousness thus the high salaries paid to actors—— help cried pellerin he leaped from the rostrum pushed everybody aside and declaring that he regarded such stupid accusations with disgust expatiated on the civilising mission of the player inasmuch as the theatre was the focus of national education he would record his vote for the reform of the theatre and to begin with no more managements no more privileges yes of any sort the actors performance excited the audience and people moved backwards and forwards knocking each other down no more academies no more institutes no missions no more bachelorships down with university degrees let us preserve them said sénécal but let them be conferred by universal suffrage by the people the only true judge besides these things were not the most useful it was necessary to take a level which would be above the heads of the wealthy and he represented them as gorging themselves with crimes under their gilded ceilings while the poor writhing in their garrets with famine cultivated every virtue the applause became so vehement that he interrupted his discourse for several minutes he remained with his eyes closed his head thrown back and as it were lulling himself to sleep over the fury which he had aroused then he began to talk in a dogmatic fashion in phrases as imperious as laws the state should take possession of the banks and of the insurance offices inheritances should be abolished a social fund should be established for the workers many other measures were desirable in the future for the time being these would suffice and returning to the question of the elections we want pure citizens men entirely fresh let some one offer himself frederick arose there was a buzz of approval made by his friends but sénécal assuming the attitude of a fouquiertinville began to ask questions as to his christian name and surname his antecedents life and morals frederick answered succinctly and bit his lips sénécal asked whether anyone saw any impediment to this candidature no no but for his part he saw some all around him bent forward and strained their ears to listen the citizen who was seeking for their support had not delivered a certain sum promised by him for the foundation of a democratic journal moreover on the twentysecond of february though he had had sufficient notice on the subject he had failed to be at the meetingplace in the place de panthéon i swear that he was at the tuileries exclaimed dussardier can you swear to having seen him at the panthéon dussardier hung down his head frederick was silent his friends scandalised regarded him with disquietude in any case sénécal went on do you know a patriot who will answer to us for your principles i will said dussardier oh this is not enough another frederick turned round to pellerin the artist replied to him with a great number of gestures which meant ah my dear boy they have rejected myself the deuce what would you have thereupon frederick gave regimbart a nudge yes thats true tis time im going and regimbart stepped upon the platform then pointing towards the spaniard who had followed him allow me citizens to present to you a patriot from barcelona the patriot made a low bow rolled his gleaming eyes about and with his hand on his heart ciudadanos mucho aprecio el honor that you have bestowed on me however great may be vuestra bondad mayor vuestra atención i claim the right to speak cried frederick desde que se proclamo la constitutión de cadiz ese pacto fundamental of las libertades españolas hasta la ultima revolución nuestra patria cuenta numerosos y heroicos mártires frederick once more made an effort to obtain a hearing but citizens— the spaniard went on el martes proximo tendra lugar en la iglesia de la magdelena un servicio fúnebre in fact this is ridiculous nobody understands him this observation exasperated the audience turn him out turn him out who i asked frederick yourself said sénécal majestically out with you he rose to leave and the voice of the iberian pursued him y todos los españoles descarien ver alli reunidas las disputaciónes de los clubs y de la milicia nacional an oración fúnebre en honour of the libertad española y del mundo entero will be prononciado por un miembro del clero of paris en la sala bonne nouvelle honour al pueblo frances que llamaria yo el primero pueblo del mundo sino fuese ciudadano de otra nación aristo screamed one blackguard shaking his fist at frederick as the latter boiling with indignation rushed out into the yard adjoining the place where the meeting was held he reproached himself for his devotedness without reflecting that after all the accusations brought against him were just what fatal idea was this candidature but what asses what idiots he drew comparisons between himself and these men and soothed his wounded pride with the thought of their stupidity then he felt the need of seeing rosanette after such an exhibition of ugly traits and so much magniloquence her dainty person would be a source of relaxation she was aware that he had intended to present himself at a club that evening however she did not even ask him a single question when he came in she was sitting near the fire ripping open the lining of a dress he was surprised to find her thus occupied hallo what are you doing you can see for yourself said she dryly i am mending my clothes so much for this republic of yours why do you call it mine perhaps you want to make out that its mine and she began to upbraid him for everything that had happened in france for the last two months accusing him of having brought about the revolution and with having ruined her prospects by making everybody that had money leave paris and that she would byandby be dying in a hospital it is easy for you to talk lightly about it with your yearly income however at the rate at which things are going on you wont have your yearly income long that may be said frederick the most devoted are always misunderstood and if one were not sustained by ones conscience the brutes that you mix yourself up with would make you feel disgusted with your own selfdenial rosanette gazed at him with knitted brows eh what what selfdenial monsieur has not succeeded it would seem so much the better it will teach you to make patriotic donations oh dont lie i know you have given them three hundred francs for this republic of yours has to be kept well amuse yourself with it my good man under this avalanche of abuse frederick passed from his former disappointment to a more painful disillusion he withdrew to the lower end of the apartment she came up to him look here think it out a bit in a country as in a house there must be a master otherwise everyone pockets something out of the money spent at first everybody knows that ledrurollin is head over ears in debt as for lamartine how can you expect a poet to understand politics ah tis all very well for you to shake your head and to presume that you have more brains than others all the same what i say is true but you are always cavilling a person cant get in a word with you for instance theres fournierfontaine who had stores at saintroch do you know how much he failed for eight hundred thousand francs and gomer the packer opposite to him—another republican that one—he smashed the tongs on his wifes head and he drank so much absinthe that he is going to be put into a private asylum thats the way with the whole of them—the republicans a republic at twentyfive percent ah yes plume yourself upon it frederick took himself off he was disgusted at the foolishness of this girl which revealed itself all at once in the language of the populace he felt himself even becoming a little patriotic once more the illtemper of rosanette only increased mademoiselle vatnaz irritated him with her enthusiasm believing that she had a mission she felt a furious desire to make speeches to carry on disputes and—sharper than rosanette in matters of this sort—overwhelmed her with arguments one day she made her appearance burning with indignation against hussonnet who had just indulged in some blackguard remarks at the womans club rosanette approved of this conduct declaring even that she would take mens clothes to go and give them a bit of her mind the entire lot of them and to whip them frederick entered at the same moment youll accompany me—wont you and in spite of his presence a bickering match took place between them one of them playing the part of a citizens wife and the other of a female philosopher according to rosanette women were born exclusively for love or in order to bring up children to be housekeepers according to mademoiselle vatnaz women ought to have a position in the government in former times the gaulish women and also the anglosaxon women took part in the legislation the squaws of the hurons formed a portion of the council the work of civilisation was common to both it was necessary that all should contribute towards it and that fraternity should be substituted for egoism association for individualism and cultivation on a large scale for minute subdivision of land come that is good you know a great deal about culture just now why not besides it is a question of humanity of its future mind your own business this is my business they got into a passion frederick interposed the vatnaz became very heated and went so far as to uphold communism what nonsense said rosanette how could such a thing ever come to pass the other brought forward in support of her theory the examples of the essenes the moravian brethren the jesuits of paraguay the family of the pingons near thiers in auvergne and as she gesticulated a great deal her gold chain got entangled in her bundle of trinkets to which was attached a gold ornament in the form of a sheep suddenly rosanette turned exceedingly pale mademoiselle vatnaz continued extricating her trinkets dont give yourself so much trouble said rosanette now i know your political opinions what replied the vatnaz with a blush on her face like that of a virgin oh oh you understand me frederick did not understand there had evidently been something taking place between them of a more important and intimate character than socialism and even though it should be so said the vatnaz in reply rising up unflinchingly tis a loan my dear—set off one debt against the other faith i dont deny my own debts i owe some thousands of francs—a nice sum i borrow at least i dont rob anyone mademoiselle vatnaz made an effort to laugh oh i would put my hand in the fire for him take care it is dry enough to burn the spinster held out her right hand to her and keeping it raised in front of her but there are friends of yours who find it convenient for them andalusians i suppose as castanets you beggar the maréchale made her a low bow theres nobody so charming mademoiselle vatnaz made no reply beads of perspiration appeared on her temples her eyes fixed themselves on the carpet she panted for breath at last she reached the door and slamming it vigorously good night youll hear from me much i care said rosanette the effort of selfsuppression had shattered her nerves she sank down on the divan shaking all over stammering forth words of abuse shedding tears was it this threat on the part of the vatnaz that had caused so much agitation in her mind oh no what did she care indeed about that one it was the golden sheep a present and in the midst of her tears the name of delmar escaped her lips so then she was in love with the mummer in that case why did she take on with me frederick asked himself how is it that he has come back again who compels her to keep me where is the sense of this sort of thing rosanette was still sobbing she remained all the time stretched at the edge of the divan with her right cheek resting on her two hands and she seemed a being so dainty so free from selfconsciousness and so sorely troubled that he drew closer to her and softly kissed her on the forehead thereupon she gave him assurances of her affection for him the prince had just left her they would be free but she was for the time being short of money you saw yourself that this was so the other day when i was trying to turn my old linings to use no more equipages now and this was not all the upholsterer was threatening to resume possession of the bedroom and the large drawingroom furniture she did not know what to do frederick had a mind to answer dont annoy yourself about it i will pay but the lady knew how to lie experience had enlightened her he confined himself to mere expressions of sympathy rosanettes fears were not vain it was necessary to give up the furniture and to quit the handsome apartment in the rue drouot she took another on the boulevard poissonnière on the fourth floor the curiosities of her old boudoir were quite sufficient to give to the three rooms a coquettish air there were chinese blinds a tent on the terrace and in the drawingroom a secondhand carpet still perfectly new with ottomans covered with pink silk frederick had contributed largely to these purchases he had felt the joy of a newlymarried man who possesses at last a house of his own a wife of his own—and being much pleased with the place he used to sleep there nearly every evening one morning as he was passing out through the anteroom he saw on the third floor on the staircase the shako of a national guard who was ascending it where in the world was he going frederick waited the man continued his progress up the stairs with his head slightly bent down he raised his eyes it was my lord arnoux the situation was clear they both reddened simultaneously overcome by a feeling of embarrassment common to both arnoux was the first to find a way out of the difficulty she is better—isnt that so as if rosanette were ill and he had come to learn how she was frederick took advantage of this opening yes certainly at least so i was told by her maid wishing to convey that he had not been allowed to see her then they stood facing each other both undecided as to what they would do next and eyeing one another intently the question now was which of the two was going to remain arnoux once more solved the problem pshaw ill come back byandby where are you going i go with you and when they were in the street he chatted as naturally as usual unquestionably he was not a man of jealous disposition or else he was too goodnatured to get angry besides his time was devoted to serving his country he never left off his uniform now on the twentyninth of march he had defended the offices of the presse when the chamber was invaded he distinguished himself by his courage and he was at the banquet given to the national guard at amiens hussonnet who was still on duty with him availed himself of his flask and his cigars but irreverent by nature he delighted in contradicting him disparaging the somewhat inaccurate style of the decrees and decrying the conferences at the luxembourg the women known as the vésuviennes the political section bearing the name of tyroliens everything in fact down to the car of agriculture drawn by horses to the oxmarket and escorted by illfavoured young girls arnoux on the other hand was the upholder of authority and dreamed of uniting the different parties however his own affairs had taken an unfavourable turn and he was more or less anxious about them he was not much troubled about fredericks relations with the maréchale for this discovery made him feel justified in withdrawing the allowance which he had renewed since the prince had left her he pleaded by way of excuse for this step the embarrassed condition in which he found himself uttered many lamentations—and rosanette was generous the result was that m arnoux regarded himself as the lover who appealed entirely to the heart an idea that raised him in his own estimation and made him feel young again having no doubt that frederick was paying the maréchale he fancied that he was playing a nice trick on the young man even called at the house in such a stealthy fashion as to keep the other in ignorance of the fact and when they happened to meet left the coast clear for him frederick was not pleased with this partnership and his rivals politeness seemed only an elaborate piece of sarcasm but by taking offence at it he would have removed from his path every opportunity of ever finding his way back to madame arnoux and then this was the only means whereby he could hear about her movements the earthenwaredealer in accordance with his usual practice or perhaps with some cunning design recalled her readily in the course of conversation and asked him why he no longer came to see her frederick having exhausted every excuse he could frame assured him that he had called several times to see madame arnoux but without success arnoux was convinced that this was so for he had often referred in an eager tone at home to the absence of their friend and she had invariably replied that she was out when he called so that these two lies in place of contradicting corroborated each other the young mans gentle ways and the pleasure of finding a dupe in him made arnoux like him all the better he carried familiarity to its extreme limits not through disdain but through assurance one day he wrote saying that very urgent business compelled him to be away in the country for twentyfour hours he begged of the young man to mount guard in his stead frederick dared not refuse so he repaired to the guardhouse in the place du carrousel he had to submit to the society of the national guards and with the exception of a sugarrefiner a witty fellow who drank to an inordinate extent they all appeared to him more stupid than their cartridgeboxes the principal subject of conversation amongst them was the substitution of sashes for belts others declaimed against the national workshops one man said where are we going the man to whom the words had been addressed opened his eyes as if he were standing on the verge of an abyss where are we going then one who was more daring than the rest exclaimed it cannot last it must come to an end and as the same kind of talk went on till night frederick was bored to death great was his surprise when at eleven oclock he suddenly beheld arnoux who immediately explained that he had hurried back to set him at liberty having disposed of his own business the fact was that he had no business to transact the whole thing was an invention to enable him to spend twentyfour hours alone with rosanette but the worthy arnoux had placed too much confidence in his own powers so that now in the state of lassitude which was the result he was seized with remorse he had come to thank frederick and to invite him to have some supper a thousand thanks im not hungry all i want is to go to bed a reason the more for having a snack together how flabby you are one does not go home at such an hour as this it is too late it would be dangerous frederick once more yielded arnoux was quite a favorite with his brethreninarms who had not expected to see him—and he was a particular crony of the refiner they were all fond of him and he was such a good fellow that he was sorry hussonnet was not there but he wanted to shut his eyes for one minute no longer sit down beside me said he to frederick stretching himself on the campbed without taking off his belt and straps through fear of an alarm in spite of the regulation he even kept his gun in his hand then stammered out some words my darling my little angel and ere long was fast asleep those who had been talking to each other became silent and gradually there was a deep silence in the guardhouse frederick tormented by the fleas kept staring about him the wall painted yellow had halfway up a long shelf on which the knapsacks formed a succession of little humps while underneath the muskets which had the colour of lead rose up side by side and there could be heard a succession of snores produced by the national guards whose stomachs were outlined through the darkness in a confused fashion on the top of the stove stood an empty bottle and some plates three straw chairs were drawn around the table on which a pack of cards was displayed a drum in the middle of the bench let its strap hang down a warm breath of air making its way through the door caused the lamp to smoke arnoux slept with his two arms wide apart and as his gun was placed in a slightly crooked position with the buttend downward the mouth of the barrel came up right under his arm frederick noticed this and was alarmed but no im wrong theres nothing to be afraid of and yet suppose he met his death and immediately pictures unrolled themselves before his mind in endless succession he saw himself with her at night in a postchaise then on a rivers bank on a summers evening and under the reflection of a lamp at home in their own house he even fixed his attention on household expenses and domestic arrangements contemplating feeling already his happiness between his hands and in order to realise it all that was needed was that the cock of the gun should rise the end of it could be pushed with ones toe the gun would go off—it would be a mere accident—nothing more frederick brooded over this idea like a playwright in the agonies of composition suddenly it seemed to him that it was not far from being carried into practical operation and that he was going to contribute to that result—that in fact he was yearning for it and then a feeling of absolute terror took possession of him in the midst of this mental distress he experienced a sense of pleasure and he allowed himself to sink deeper and deeper into it with a dreadful consciousness all the time that his scruples were vanishing in the wildness of his reverie the rest of the world became effaced and he could only realise that he was still alive from the intolerable oppression on his chest let us take a drop of white wine said the refiner as he awoke arnoux sprang to his feet and as soon as the white wine was swallowed he wanted to relieve frederick of his sentry duty then he brought him to have breakfast in the rue de chartres at parlys and as he required to recuperate his energies he ordered two dishes of meat a lobster an omelet with rum a salad etc and finished this off with a brand of sauterne of 1819 and one of 42 romanée not to speak of the champagne at dessert and the liqueurs frederick did not in any way gainsay him he was disturbed in mind as if by the thought that the other might somehow trace on his countenance the idea that had lately flitted before his imagination with both elbows on the table and his head bent forward so that he annoyed frederick by his fixed stare he confided some of his hobbies to the young man he wanted to take for farming purposes all the embankments on the northern line in order to plant potatoes there or else to organise on the boulevards a monster cavalcade in which the celebrities of the period would figure he would let all the windows which would at the rate of three francs for each person produce a handsome profit in short he dreamed of a great stroke of fortune by means of a monopoly he assumed a moral tone nevertheless found fault with excesses and all sorts of misconduct spoke about his poor father and every evening as he said made an examination of his conscience before offering his soul to god a little curaçao eh just as you please as for the republic things would right themselves in fact he looked on himself as the happiest man on earth and forgetting himself he exalted rosanettes attractive qualities and even compared her with his wife it was quite a different thing you could not imagine a lovelier person your health frederick touched glasses with him he had out of complaisance drunk a little too much besides the strong sunlight dazzled him and when they went up the rue vivienne together again their shoulders touched each other in a fraternal fashion when he got home frederick slept till seven oclock after that he called on the maréchale she had gone out with somebody—with arnoux perhaps not knowing what to do with himself he continued his promenade along the boulevard but could not get past the porte saintmartin owing to the great crowd that blocked the way want had abandoned to their own resources a considerable number of workmen and they used to come there every evening no doubt for the purpose of holding a review and awaiting a signal in spite of the law against riotous assemblies these clubs of despair increased to a frightful extent and many citizens repaired every day to the spot through bravado and because it was the fashion all of a sudden frederick caught a glimpse three paces away of m dambreuse along with martinon he turned his head away for m dambreuse having got himself nominated as a representative of the people he cherished a secret spite against him but the capitalist stopped him one word my dear monsieur i have some explanations to make to you i am not asking you for any pray listen to me it was not his fault in any way appeals had been made to him pressure had to a certain extent been placed on him martinon immediately endorsed all that he had said some of the electors of nogent had presented themselves in a deputation at his house besides i expected to be free as soon as—— a crush of people on the footpath forced m dambreuse to get out of the way a minute after he reappeared saying to martinon this is a genuine service really and you wont have any reason to regret—— all three stood with their backs resting against a shop in order to be able to chat more at their ease from time to time there was a cry of long live napoléon long live barbès down with marie the countless throng kept talking in very loud tones and all these voices echoing through the houses made so to speak the continuous ripple of waves in a harbour at intervals they ceased and then could be heard voices singing the marseillaise under the courtgates men of mysterious aspect offered swordsticks to those who passed sometimes two individuals one of whom preceded the other would wink and then quickly hurry away the footpaths were filled with groups of staring idlers a dense crowd swayed to and fro on the pavement entire bands of policeofficers emerging from the alleys had scarcely made their way into the midst of the multitude when they were swallowed up in the mass of people little red flags here and there looked like flames coachmen from the place where they sat high up gesticulated energetically and then turned to go back it was a case of perpetual movement—one of the strangest sights that could be conceived how all this said martinon would have amused mademoiselle cécile my wife as you are aware does not like my niece to come with us returned m dambreuse with a smile one could scarcely recognise in him the same man for the past three months he had been crying long live the republic and he had even voted in favour of the banishment of orléans but there should be an end of concessions he exhibited his rage so far as to carry a tomahawk in his pocket martinon had one too the magistracy not being any longer irremovable he had withdrawn from parquet so that he surpassed m dambreuse in his display of violence the banker had a special antipathy to lamartine and at the same time to pierre leroux proudhon considérant lamennais and all the cranks all the socialists for in fact what is it they want the duty on meat and arrest for debt have been abolished now the project of a bank for mortgages is under consideration the other day it was a national bank and here are five millions in the budget for the workingmen but luckily it is over thanks to monsieur de falloux goodbye to them let them go in fact not knowing how to maintain the three hundred thousand men in the national workshops the minister of public works had that very day signed an order inviting all citizens between the ages of eighteen and twenty to take service as soldiers or else to start for the provinces to cultivate the ground there they were indignant at the alternative thus put before them convinced that the object was to destroy the republic they were aggrieved by the thought of having to live at a distance from the capital as if it were a kind of exile they saw themselves dying of fevers in desolate parts of the country to many of them moreover who had been accustomed to work of a refined description agriculture seemed a degradation it was in short a mockery a decisive breach of all the promises which had been made to them if they offered any resistance force would be employed against them they had no doubt of it and made preparations to anticipate it about nine oclock the riotous assemblies which had formed at the bastille and at the châtelet ebbed back towards the boulevard from the porte saintdenis to the porte saintmartin nothing could be seen save an enormous swarm of people a single mass of a dark blue shade nearly black the men of whom one caught a glimpse all had glowing eyes pale complexions faces emaciated with hunger and excited with a sense of wrong meanwhile some clouds had gathered the tempestuous sky roused the electricity that was in the people and they kept whirling about of their own accord with the great swaying movements of a swelling sea and one felt that there was an incalculable force in the depths of this excited throng and as it were the energy of an element then they all began exclaiming lamps lamps many windows had no illumination and stones were flung at the panes m dambreuse deemed it prudent to withdraw from the scene the two young men accompanied him home he predicted great disasters the people might once more invade the chamber and on this point he told them how he should have been killed on the fifteenth of may had it not been for the devotion of a national guard but i had forgotten he is a friend of yours—your friend the earthenware manufacturer—jacques arnoux the rioters had been actually throttling him when that brave citizen caught him in his arms and put him safely out of their reach so it was that since then there had been a kind of intimacy between them it would be necessary one of these days to dine together and since you often see him give him the assurance that i like him very much he is an excellent man and has in my opinion been slandered and he has his wits about him in the morning my compliments once more a very good evening frederick after he had quitted m dambreuse went back to the maréchale and in a very gloomy fashion said that she should choose between him and arnoux she replied that she did not understand dumps of this sort that she did not care about arnoux and had no desire to cling to him frederick was thirsting to fly from paris she did not offer any opposition to this whim and next morning they set out for fontainebleau the hotel at which they stayed could be distinguished from others by a fountain that rippled in the middle of the courtyard attached to it the doors of the various apartments opened out on a corridor as in monasteries the room assigned to them was large wellfurnished hung with print and noiseless owing to the scarcity of tourists alongside the houses people who had nothing to do kept passing up and down then under their windows when the day was declining children in the street would engage in a game of base and this tranquillity following so soon the tumult they had witnessed in paris filled them with astonishment and exercised over them a soothing influence every morning at an early hour they went to pay a visit to the château as they passed in through the gate they had a view of its entire front with the five pavilions covered with sharppointed roofs and its staircase of horseshoeshape opening out to the end of the courtyard which is hemmed in to right and left by two main portions of the building further down on the paved ground lichens blended their colours here and there with the tawny hue of bricks and the entire appearance of the palace rustcoloured like old armour had about it something of the impassiveness of royalty—a sort of warlike melancholy grandeur at last a manservant made his appearance with a bunch of keys in his hand he first showed them the apartments of the queens the popes oratory the gallery of francis i the mahogany table on which the emperor signed his abdication and in one of the rooms cut in two the old galerie des cerfs the place where christine got monaldeschi assassinated rosanette listened to this narrative attentively then turning towards frederick no doubt it was through jealousy mind yourself after this they passed through the council chamber the guards room the throne room and the drawingroom of louis xiii the uncurtained windows sent forth a white light the handles of the windowfastenings and the copper feet of the piertables were slightly tarnished with dust the armchairs were everywhere hidden under coarse linen covers above the doors could be seen reliquaries of louis xiv and here and there hangings representing the gods of olympus psyche or the battles of alexander as she was passing in front of the mirrors rosanette stopped for a moment to smooth her headbands after passing through the donjoncourt and the saintsaturnin chapel they reached the festal hall they were dazzled by the magnificence of the ceiling which was divided into octagonal apartments set off with gold and silver more finely chiselled than a jewel and by the vast number of paintings covering the walls from the immense chimneypiece where the arms of france were surrounded by crescents and quivers down to the musicians gallery which had been erected at the other end along the entire width of the hall the ten arched windows were wide open the sun threw its lustre on the pictures so that they glowed beneath its rays the blue sky continued in an endless curve the ultramarine of the arches and from the depths of the woods where the lofty summits of the trees filled up the horizon there seemed to come an echo of flourishes blown by ivory trumpets and mythological ballets gathering together under the foliage princesses and nobles disguised as nymphs or fauns—an epoch of ingenuous science of violent passions and sumptuous art when the ideal was to sweep away the world in a vision of the hesperides and when the mistresses of kings mingled their glory with the stars there was a portrait of one of the most beautiful of these celebrated women in the form of diana the huntress and even the infernal diana no doubt in order to indicate the power which she possessed even beyond the limits of the tomb all these symbols confirmed her glory and there remained about the spot something of her an indistinct voice a radiation that stretched out indefinitely a feeling of mysterious retrospective voluptuousness took possession of frederick in order to divert these passionate longings into another channel he began to gaze tenderly on rosanette and asked her would she not like to have been this woman what woman diane de poitiers he repeated diane de poitiers the mistress of henry ii she gave utterance to a little ah that was all her silence clearly demonstrated that she knew nothing about the matter and had failed to comprehend his meaning so that out of complaisance he said to her perhaps you are getting tired of this no no—quite the reverse and lifting up her chin and casting around her a glance of the vaguest description rosanette let these words escape her lips it recalls some memories to me meanwhile it was easy to trace on her countenance a strained expression a certain sense of awe and as this air of gravity made her look all the prettier frederick overlooked it the carps pond amused her more for a quarter of an hour she kept flinging pieces of bread into the water in order to see the fishes skipping about frederick had seated himself by her side under the lindentrees he saw in imagination all the personages who had haunted these walls—charles v the valois kings henry iv peter the great jean jacques rousseau and the fair mourners of the stageboxes voltaire napoléon pius vii and louis philippe and he felt himself environed elbowed by these tumultuous dead people he was stunned by such a confusion of historic figures even though he found a certain fascination in contemplating them nevertheless at length they descended into the flowergarden it is a vast rectangle which presents to the spectator at the first glance its wide yellow walks its square grassplots its ribbons of boxwood its yewtrees shaped like pyramids its lowlying green swards and its narrow borders in which thinlysown flowers make spots on the grey soil at the end of the garden may be seen a park through whose entire length a canal makes its way royal residences have attached to them a peculiar kind of melancholy due no doubt to their dimensions being much too large for the limited number of guests entertained within them to the silence which one feels astonished to find in them after so many flourishes of trumpets to the immobility of their luxurious furniture which attests by the aspect of age and decay it gradually assumes the transitory character of dynasties the eternal wretchedness of all things and this exhalation of the centuries enervating and funereal like the perfume of a mummy makes itself felt even in untutored brains rosanette yawned immoderately they went back to the hotel after their breakfast an open carriage came round for them they started from fontainebleau at a point where several roads diverged then went up at a walking pace a gravelly road leading towards a little pinewood the trees became larger and from time to time the driver would say this is the frères siamois the pharamond the bouquet de roi not forgetting a single one of these notable sites sometimes even drawing up to enable them to admire the scene they entered the forest of franchard the carriage glided over the grass like a sledge pigeons which they could not see began cooing suddenly the waiter of a café made his appearance and they alighted before the railing of a garden in which a number of round tables were placed then passing on the left by the walls of a ruined abbey they made their way over big boulders of stone and soon reached the lower part of the gorge it is covered on one side with sandstones and junipertrees tangled together while on the other side the ground almost quite bare slopes towards the hollow of the valley where a foottrack makes a pale line through the brown heather and far above could be traced a flat coneshaped summit with a telegraphtower behind it halfanhour later they stepped out of the vehicle once more in order to climb the heights of aspremont the roads form zigzags between the thickset pinetrees under rocks with angular faces all this corner of the forest has a sort of chokedup look—a rather wild and solitary aspect one thinks of hermits in connection with it—companions of huge stags with fiery crosses between their horns who were wont to welcome with paternal smiles the good kings of france when they knelt before their grottoes the warm air was filled with a resinous odour and roots of trees crossed one another like veins close to the soil rosanette slipped over them grew dejected and felt inclined to shed tears but at the very top she became joyous once more on finding under a roof made of branches a sort of tavern where carved wood was sold she drank a bottle of lemonade and bought a hollystick and without one glance towards the landscape which disclosed itself from the plateau she entered the brigands cave with a waiter carrying a torch in front of her their carriage was awaiting them in the bas breau a painter in a blue blouse was working at the foot of an oaktree with his box of colours on his knees he raised his head and watched them as they passed in the middle of the hill of chailly the sudden breaking of a cloud caused them to turn up the hoods of their cloaks almost immediately the rain stopped and the pavingstones of the street glistened under the sun when they were reentering the town some travellers who had recently arrived informed them that a terrible battle had stained paris with blood rosanette and her lover were not surprised then everybody left the hotel became quiet the gas was put out and they were lulled to sleep by the murmur of the fountain in the courtyard on the following day they went to see the wolfs gorge the fairies pool the long rock and the marlotte two days later they began again at random just as their coachman thought fit to drive them without asking where they were and often even neglecting the famous sites they felt so comfortable in their old landau low as a sofa and covered with a rug made of a striped material which was quite faded the moats filled with brushwood stretched out under their eyes with a gentle continuous movement white rays passed like arrows through the tall ferns sometimes a road that was no longer used presented itself before them in a straight line and here and there might be seen a feeble growth of weeds in the centre between four crossroads a crucifix extended its four arms in other places stakes were bending down like dead trees and little curved paths which were lost under the leaves made them feel a longing to pursue them at the same moment the horse turned round they entered there they plunged into the mire further down moss had sprouted out at the sides of the deep ruts they believed that they were far away from all other people quite alone but suddenly a gamekeeper with his gun or a band of women in rags with big bundles of fagots on their backs would hurry past them when the carriage stopped there was a universal silence the only sounds that reached them were the blowing of the horse in the shafts with the faint cry of a bird more than once repeated the light at certain points illuminating the outskirts of the wood left the interior in deep shadow or else attenuated in the foreground by a sort of twilight it exhibited in the background violet vapours a white radiance the midday sun falling directly on wide tracts of greenery made splashes of light over them hung gleaming drops of silver from the ends of the branches streaked the grass with long lines of emeralds and flung gold spots on the beds of dead leaves when they let their heads fall back they could distinguish the sky through the tops of the trees some of them which were enormously high looked like patriarchs or emperors or touching one another at their extremities formed with their long shafts as it were triumphal arches others sprouting forth obliquely from below seemed like falling columns this heap of big vertical lines gaped open then enormous green billows unrolled themselves in unequal embossments as far as the surface of the valleys towards which advanced the brows of other hills looking down on white plains which ended by losing themselves in an undefined pale tinge standing side by side on some rising ground they felt as they drank in the air the pride of a life more free penetrating into the depths of their souls with a superabundance of energy a joy which they could not explain the variety of trees furnished a spectacle of the most diversified character the beeches with their smooth white bark twisted their tops together ash trees softly curved their bluish branches in the tufts of the hornbeams rose up holly stiff as bronze then came a row of thin birches bent into elegiac attitudes and the pinetrees symmetrical as organ pipes seemed to be singing a song as they swayed to and fro there were gigantic oaks with knotted forms which had been violently shaken stretched themselves out from the soil and pressed close against each other and with firm trunks resembling torsos launched forth to heaven despairing appeals with their bare arms and furious threats like a group of titans struck motionless in the midst of their rage an atmosphere of gloom a feverish languor brooded over the pools whose sheets of water were cut into flakes by the overshadowing thorntrees the lichens on their banks where the wolves come to drink are of the colour of sulphur burnt as it were by the footprints of witches and the incessant croaking of the frogs responds to the cawing of the crows as they wheel through the air after this they passed through the monotonous glades planted here and there with a staddle the sound of iron falling with a succession of rapid blows could be heard on the side of the hill a group of quarrymen were breaking the rocks these rocks became more and more numerous and finally filled up the entire landscape cubeshaped like houses flat like flagstones propping up overhanging and became intermingled with each other as if they were the ruins unrecognisable and monstrous of some vanished city but the wild chaos they exhibited made one rather dream of volcanoes of deluges of great unknown cataclysms frederick said they had been there since the beginning of the world and would remain so till the end rosanette turned aside her head declaring that this would drive her out of her mind and went off to collect sweet heather the little violet blossoms heaped up near one another formed unequal plates and the soil which was giving way underneath placed soft dark fringes on the sand spangled with mica one day they reached a point halfway up a hill where the soil was full of sand its surface untrodden till now was streaked so as to resemble symmetrical waves here and there like promontories on the dry bed of an ocean rose up rocks with the vague outlines of animals tortoises thrusting forward their heads crawling seals hippopotami and bears not a soul around them not a single sound the shingle glowed under the dazzling rays of the sun and all at once in this vibration of light the specimens of the brute creation that met their gaze began to move about they returned home quickly flying from the dizziness that had seized hold of them almost dismayed the gravity of the forest exercised an influence over them and hours passed in silence during which allowing themselves to yield to the lulling effects of springs they remained as it were sunk in the torpor of a calm intoxication with his arm around her waist he listened to her talking while the birds were warbling noticed with the same glance the black grapes on her bonnet and the juniperberries the draperies of her veil and the spiral forms assumed by the clouds and when he bent towards her the freshness of her skin mingled with the strong perfume of the woods they found amusement in everything they showed one another as a curiosity gossamer threads of the virgin hanging from bushes holes full of water in the middle of stones a squirrel on the branches the way in which two butterflies kept flying after them or else at twenty paces from them under the trees a hind strode on peacefully with an air of nobility and gentleness its doe walking by its side rosanette would have liked to run after it to embrace it she got very much alarmed once when a man suddenly presenting himself showed her three vipers in a box she wildly flung herself on fredericks breast he felt happy at the thought that she was weak and that he was strong enough to defend her that evening they dined at an inn on the banks of the seine the table was near the window rosanette sitting opposite him and he contemplated her little wellshaped white nose her turnedup lips her bright eyes the swelling bands of her nutbrown hair and her pretty oval face her dress of raw silk clung to her somewhat drooping shoulders and her two hands emerging from their sleeves joined close together as if they were one—carved poured out wine moved over the tablecloth the waiters placed before them a chicken with its four limbs stretched out a stew of eels in a dish of pipeclay wine that had got spoiled bread that was too hard and knives with notches in them all these things made the repast more enjoyable and strengthened the illusion they fancied that they were in the middle of a journey in italy on their honeymoon before starting again they went for a walk along the bank of the river the soft blue sky rounded like a dome leaned at the horizon on the indentations of the woods on the opposite side at the end of the meadow there was a village steeple and further away to the left the roof of a house made a red spot on the river which wound its way without any apparent motion some rushes bent over it however and the water lightly shook some poles fixed at its edge in order to hold nets an osier bownet and two or three old fishingboats might be seen there near the inn a girl in a straw hat was drawing buckets out of a well every time they came up again frederick heard the grating sound of the chain with a feeling of inexpressible delight he had no doubt that he would be happy till the end of his days so natural did his felicity appear to him so much a part of his life and so intimately associated with this womans being he was irresistibly impelled to address her with words of endearment she answered with pretty little speeches light taps on the shoulder displays of tenderness that charmed him by their unexpectedness he discovered in her quite a new sort of beauty in fact which was perhaps only the reflection of surrounding things unless it happened to bud forth from their hidden potentialities when they were lying down in the middle of the field he would stretch himself out with his head on her lap under the shelter of her parasol or else with their faces turned towards the green sward in the centre of which they rested they kept gazing towards one another so that their pupils seemed to intermingle thirsting for one another and ever satiating their thirst and then with halfclosed eyelids they lay side by side without uttering a single word now and then the distant rolling of a drum reached their ears it was the signaldrum which was being beaten in the different villages calling on people to go and defend paris oh look here tis the rising said frederick with a disdainful pity all this excitement now presenting to his mind a pitiful aspect by the side of their love and of eternal nature and they talked about whatever happened to come into their heads things that were perfectly familiar to them persons in whom they took no interest a thousand trifles she chatted with him about her chambermaid and her hairdresser one day she was so selfforgetful that she told him her age—twentynine years she was becoming quite an old woman several times without intending it she gave him some particulars with reference to her own life she had been a shop girl had taken a trip to england and had begun studying for the stage all this she told without any explanation of how these changes had come about and he found it impossible to reconstruct her entire history she related to him more about herself one day when they were seated side by side under a planetree at the back of a meadow at the roadside further down a little barefooted girl standing amid a heap of dust was making a cow go to pasture as soon as she caught sight of them she came up to beg and while with one hand she held up her tattered petticoat she kept scratching with the other her black hair which like a wig of louis xivs time curled round her dark face lighted by a magnificent pair of eyes she will be very pretty byandby said frederick how lucky she is if she has no mother remarked rosanette eh how is that certainly i if it were not for mine—— she sighed and began to speak about her childhood her parents were weavers in the croixrousse she acted as an apprentice to her father in vain did the poor man wear himself out with hard work his wife was continually abusing him and sold everything for drink rosanette could see as if it were yesterday the room they occupied with the looms ranged lengthwise against the windows the pot boiling on the stove the bed painted like mahogany a cupboard facing it and the obscure loft where she used to sleep up to the time when she was fifteen years old at length a gentleman made his appearance on the scene—a fat man with a face of the colour of boxwood the manners of a devotee and a suit of black clothes her mother and this man had a conversation together with the result that three days afterwards—rosanette stopped and with a look in which there was as much bitterness as shamelessness it was done then in response to a gesture of frederick as he was married i was brought to a private room in a restaurant and told that i would be happy that i would get a handsome present at the door the first thing that struck me was a candelabrum of vermilion on a table on which there were two covers a mirror on the ceiling showed their reflections and the blue silk hangings on the walls made the entire apartment resemble an alcove i was seized with astonishment you understand—a poor creature who had never seen anything before in spite of my dazed condition of mind i got frightened i wanted to go away however i remained the only seat in the room was a sofa close beside the table it was so soft that it gave way under me the mouth of the hotair stove in the middle of the carpet sent out towards me a warm breath and there i sat without taking anything the waiter who was standing near me urged me to eat he poured out for me immediately a large glass of wine my head began to swim i wanted to open the window he said to me no mademoiselle that is forbidden and he left me the table was covered with a heap of things that i had no knowledge of nothing there seemed to me good then i fell back on a pot of jam and patiently waited i did not know what prevented him from coming it was very late—midnight at last—i couldnt bear the fatigue any longer while pushing aside one of the pillows in order to hear better i found under my hand a kind of album—a book of engravings they were vulgar pictures i was sleeping on top of it when he entered the room she hung down her head and remained pensive the leaves rustled around them amid the tangled grass a great foxglove was swaying to and fro the sunlight flowed like a wave over the green expanse and the silence was interrupted at intervals by the browsing of the cow which they could no longer see rosanette kept her eyes fixed on a particular spot three paces away from her her nostrils heaving and her mind absorbed in thought frederick caught hold of her hand how you suffered poor darling yes said she more than you imagine so much so that i wanted to make an end of it—they had to fish me up what ah think no more about it i love you i am happy kiss me and she picked off one by one the sprigs of the thistles which clung to the hem of her gown frederick was thinking more than all on what she had not told him what were the means by which she had gradually emerged from wretchedness to what lover did she owe her education what had occurred in her life down to the day when he first came to her house her latest avowal was a bar to these questions all he asked her was how she had made arnouxs acquaintance through the vatnaz wasnt it you that i once saw with both of them at the palaisroyal he referred to the exact date rosanette made a movement which showed a sense of deep pain yes it is true i was not gay at that time but arnoux had proved himself a very good fellow frederick had no doubt of it however their friend was a queer character full of faults he took care to recall them she quite agreed with him on this point never mind one likes him all the same this camel still—even now said frederick she began to redden half smiling half angry oh no thats an old story i dont keep anything hidden from you even though it might be so with him it is different besides i dont think you are nice towards your victim my victim rosanette caught hold of his chin no doubt and in the lisping fashion in which nurses talk to babies have always been so good never went abyby with his wife i never at any time rosanette smiled he felt hurt by this smile of hers which seemed to him a proof of indifference but she went on gently and with one of those looks which seem to appeal for a denial of the truth are you perfectly certain not a doubt of it frederick solemnly declared on his word of honour that he had never bestowed a thought on madame arnoux as he was too much in love with another woman why with you my beautiful one ah dont laugh at me you only annoy me he thought it a prudent course to invent a story—to pretend that he was swayed by a passion he manufactured some circumstantial details this woman however had rendered him very unhappy decidedly you have not been lucky said rosanette oh oh i may have been wishing to convey in this way that he had been often fortunate in his loveaffairs so that she might have a better opinion of him just as rosanette did not avow how many lovers she had had in order that he might have more respect for her—for there will always be found in the midst of the most intimate confidences restrictions false shame delicacy and pity you divine either in the other or in yourself precipices or miry paths which prevent you from penetrating any farther moreover you feel that you will not be understood it is hard to express accurately the thing you mean whatever it may be and this is the reason why perfect unions are rare the poor maréchale had never known one better than this often when she gazed at frederick tears came into her eyes then she would raise them or cast a glance towards the horizon as if she saw there some bright dawn perspectives of boundless felicity at last she confessed one day to him that she wished to have a mass said so that it might bring a blessing on our love how was it then that she had resisted him so long she could not tell herself he repeated his question a great many times and she replied as she clasped him in her arms it was because i was afraid my darling of loving you too well on sunday morning frederick read amongst the list of the wounded given in a newspaper the name of dussardier he uttered a cry and showing the paper to rosanette declared that he was going to start at once for paris for what purpose in order to see him to nurse him you are not going im sure to leave me by myself come with me ha to poke my nose in a squabble of that sort oh no thanks however i cannot—— ta ta ta as if they had need of nurses in the hospitals and then what concern is he of yours any longer everyone for himself he was roused to indignation by this egoism on her part and he reproached himself for not being in the capital with the others such indifference to the misfortunes of the nation had in it something shabby and only worthy of a small shopkeeper and now all of a sudden his intrigue with rosanette weighed on his mind as if it were a crime for an hour they were quite cool towards each other then she appealed to him to wait and not expose himself to danger suppose you happen to be killed well i should only have done my duty rosanette gave a jump his first duty was to love her but no doubt he did not care about her any longer there was no common sense in what he was going to do good heavens what an idea frederick rang for his bill but to get back to pans was not an easy matter the leloir stagecoach had just left the lecomte berlins would not be starting the diligence from bourbonnais would not be passing till a late hour that night and perhaps it might be full one could never tell when he had lost a great deal of time in making enquiries about the various modes of conveyance the idea occurred to him to travel post the master of the posthouse refused to supply him with horses as frederick had no passport finally he hired an open carriage—the same one in which they had driven about the country—and at about five oclock they arrived in front of the hôtel du commerce at melun the marketplace was covered with piles of arms the prefect had forbidden the national guards to proceed towards paris those who did not belong to his department wished to go on there was a great deal of shouting and the inn was packed with a noisy crowd rosanette seized with terror said she would not go a step further and once more begged of him to stay the innkeeper and his wife joined in her entreaties a decent sort of man who happened to be dining there interposed and observed that the fighting would be over in a very short time besides one ought to do his duty thereupon the maréchale redoubled her sobs frederick got exasperated he handed her his purse kissed her quickly and disappeared on reaching corbeil he learned at the station that the insurgents had cut the rails at regular distances and the coachman refused to drive him any farther he said that his horses were overspent through his influence however frederick managed to procure an indifferent cabriolet which for the sum of sixty francs without taking into account the price of a drink for the driver was to convey him as far as the italian barrier but at a hundred paces from the barrier his coachman made him descend and turn back frederick was walking along the pathway when suddenly a sentinel thrust out his bayonet four men seized him exclaiming this is one of them look out search him brigand scoundrel and he was so thoroughly stupefied that he let himself be dragged to the guardhouse of the barrier at the very point where the boulevards des gobelins and de lhôpital and rues godefroy and mauffetard converge four barricades formed at the ends of four different ways enormous sloping ramparts of pavingstones torches were glimmering here and there in spite of the rising clouds of dust he could distinguish footsoldiers of the line and national guards all with their faces blackened their chests uncovered and an aspect of wild excitement they had just captured the square and had shot down a number of men their rage had not yet cooled frederick said he had come from fontainebleau to the relief of a wounded comrade who lodged in the rue bellefond not one of them would believe him at first they examined his hands they even put their noses to his ear to make sure that he did not smell of powder however by dint of repeating the same thing he finally satisfied a captain who directed two fusiliers to conduct him to the guardhouse of the jardin des plantes they descended the boulevard de lhôpital a strong breeze was blowing it restored him to animation after this they turned up the rue du marché aux chevaux the jardin des plantes at the right formed a long black mass whilst at the left the entire front of the pitié illuminated at every window blazed like a conflagration and shadows passed rapidly over the windowpanes the two men in charge of frederick went away another accompanied him to the polytechnic school the rue saintvictor was quite dark without a gaslamp or a light at any window to relieve the gloom every ten minutes could be heard the words sentinels mind yourselves and this exclamation cast into the midst of the silence was prolonged like the repeated striking of a stone against the side of a chasm as it falls through space every now and then the stamp of heavy footsteps could be heard drawing nearer this was nothing less than a patrol consisting of about a hundred men from this confused mass escaped whisperings and the dull clanking of iron and moving away with a rhythmic swing it melted into the darkness in the middle of the crossing where several streets met a dragoon sat motionless on his horse from time to time an express rider passed at a rapid gallop then the silence was renewed cannons which were being drawn along the streets made on the pavement a heavy rolling sound that seemed full of menace—a sound different from every ordinary sound—which oppressed the heart the sounds was profound unlimited—a black silence men in white blouses accosted the soldiers spoke one or two words to them and then vanished like phantoms the guardhouse of the polytechnic school overflowed with people the threshold was blocked up with women who had come to see their sons or their husbands they were sent on to the panthéon which had been transformed into a deadhouse and no attention was paid to frederick he pressed forward resolutely solemnly declaring that his friend dussardier was waiting for him that he was at deaths door at last they sent a corporal to accompany him to the top of the rue saintjacques to the mayors office in the twelfth arrondissement the place du panthéon was filled with soldiers lying asleep on straw the day was breaking the bivouacfires were extinguished the insurrection had left terrible traces in this quarter the soil of the streets from one end to the other was covered with risings of various sizes on the wrecked barricades had been piled up omnibuses gaspipes and cartwheels in certain places there were little dark pools which must have been blood the houses were riddled with projectiles and their framework could be seen under the plaster that was peeled off windowblinds each attached only by a single nail hung like rags the staircases having fallen in doors opened on vacancy the interiors of rooms could be perceived with their papers in strips in some instances dainty objects had remained in them quite intact frederick noticed a timepiece a parrotstick and some engravings when he entered the mayors office the national guards were chattering without a moments pause about the deaths of bréa and négrier about the deputy charbonnel and about the archbishop of paris he heard them saying that the duc daumale had landed at boulogne that barbès had fled from vincennes that the artillery were coming up from bourges and that abundant aid was arriving from the provinces about three oclock some one brought good news trucebearers from the insurgents were in conference with the president of the assembly thereupon they all made merry and as he had a dozen francs left frederick sent for a dozen bottles of wine hoping by this means to hasten his deliverance suddenly a discharge of musketry was heard the drinking stopped they peered with distrustful eyes into the unknown—it might be henry v in order to get rid of responsibility they took frederick to the mayors office in the eleventh arrondissement which he was not permitted to leave till nine oclock in the morning he started at a running pace from the quai voltaire at an open window an old man in his shirtsleeves was crying with his eyes raised the seine glided peacefully along the sky was of a clear blue and in the trees round the tuileries birds were singing frederick was just crossing the place du carrousel when a litter happened to be passing by the soldiers at the guardhouse immediately presented arms and the officer putting his hand to his shako said honour to unfortunate bravery this phrase seemed to have almost become a matter of duty he who pronounced it appeared to be on each occasion filled with profound emotion a group of people in a state of fierce excitement followed the litter exclaiming we will avenge you we will avenge you the vehicles kept moving about on the boulevard and women were making lint before the doors meanwhile the outbreak had been quelled or very nearly so a proclamation from cavaignac just posted up announced the fact at the top of the rue vivienne a company of the garde mobile appeared then the citizens uttered cries of enthusiasm they raised their hats applauded danced wished to embrace them and to invite them to drink and flowers flung by ladies fell from the balconies at last at ten oclock at the moment when the cannon was booming as an attack was being made on the faubourg saintantoine frederick reached the abode of dussardier he found the bookkeeper in his garret lying asleep on his back from the adjoining apartment a woman came forth with silent tread—mademoiselle vatnaz she led frederick aside and explained to him how dussardier had got wounded on saturday on the top of a barricade in the rue lafayette a young fellow wrapped in a tricoloured flag cried out to the national guards are you going to shoot your brothers as they advanced dussardier threw down his gun pushed away the others sprang over the barricade and with a blow of an old shoe knocked down the insurgent from whom he tore the flag he had afterwards been found under a heap of rubbish with a slug of copper in his thigh it was found necessary to make an incision in order to extract the projectile mademoiselle vatnaz arrived the same evening and since then had not quitted his side she intelligently prepared everything that was needed for the dressings assisted him in taking his medicine or other liquids attended to his slightest wishes left and returned again with footsteps more light than those of a fly and gazed at him with eyes full of tenderness frederick during the two following weeks did not fail to come back every morning one day while he was speaking about the devotion of the vatnaz dussardier shrugged his shoulders oh no she does this through interested motives do you think so he replied i am sure of it without seeming disposed to give any further explanation she had loaded him with kindnesses carrying her attentions so far as to bring him the newspapers in which his gallant action was extolled he even confessed to frederick that he felt uneasy in his conscience perhaps he ought to have put himself on the other side with the men in blouses for indeed a heap of promises had been made to them which had not been carried out those who had vanquished them hated the republic and in the next place they had treated them very harshly no doubt they were in the wrong—not quite however and the honest fellow was tormented by the thought that he might have fought against the righteous cause sénécal who was immured in the tuileries under the terrace at the waters edge had none of this mental anguish there were nine hundred men in the place huddled together in the midst of filth without the slightest order their faces blackened with powder and clotted blood shivering with ague and breaking out into cries of rage and those who were brought there to die were not separated from the rest sometimes on hearing the sound of a detonation they believed that they were all going to be shot then they dashed themselves against the walls and after that fell back again into their places so much stupefied by suffering that it seemed to them that they were living in a nightmare a mournful hallucination the lamp which hung from the arched roof looked like a stain of blood and little green and yellow flames fluttered about caused by the emanations from the vault through fear of epidemics a commission was appointed when he had advanced a few steps the president recoiled frightened by the stench from the excrements and from the corpses as soon as the prisoners drew near a venthole the national guards who were on sentry in order to prevent them from shaking the bars of the grating prodded them indiscriminately with their bayonets as a rule they showed no pity those who were not beaten wished to signalise themselves there was a regular outbreak of fear they avenged themselves at the same time on newspapers clubs mobs speechmaking—everything that had exasperated them during the last three months and in spite of the victory that had been gained equality manifested itself in a triumphal fashion—an equality of brute beasts a dead level of sanguinary vileness for the fanaticism of selfinterest balanced the madness of want aristocracy had the same fits of fury as low debauchery and the cotton cap did not show itself less hideous than the red cap the public mind was agitated just as it would be after great convulsions of nature sensible men were rendered imbeciles for the rest of their lives on account of it père roque had become very courageous almost foolhardy having arrived on the 26th at paris with some of the inhabitants of nogent instead of going back at the same time with them he had gone to give his assistance to the national guard encamped at the tuileries and he was quite satisfied to be placed on sentry in front of the terrace at the waters side there at any rate he had these brigands under his feet he was delighted to find that they were beaten and humiliated and he could not refrain from uttering invectives against them one of them a young lad with long fair hair put his face to the bars and asked for bread m roque ordered him to hold his tongue but the young man repeated in a mournful tone bread have i any to give you other prisoners presented themselves at the venthole with their bristling beards their burning eyeballs all pushing forward and yelling bread père roque was indignant at seeing his authority slighted in order to frighten them he took aim at them and borne onward into the vault by the crush that nearly smothered him the young man with his head thrown backward once more exclaimed bread hold on here it is said père roque firing a shot from his gun there was a fearful howl—then silence at the side of the trough something white could be seen lying after this m roque returned to his abode for he had a house in the rue saintmartin which he used as a temporary residence and the injury done to the front of the building during the riots had in no slight degree contributed to excite his rage it seemed to him when he next saw it that he had exaggerated the amount of damage done to it his recent act had a soothing effect on him as if it indemnified him for his loss it was his daughter herself who opened the door for him she immediately made the remark that she had felt uneasy at his excessively prolonged absence she was afraid that he had met with some misfortune—that he had been wounded this manifestation of filial love softened père roque he was astonished that she should have set out on a journey without catherine i sent her out on a message was louises reply and she made enquiries about his health about one thing or another then with an air of indifference she asked him whether he had chanced to come across frederick no i didnt see him it was on his account alone that she had come up from the country some one was walking at that moment in the lobby oh excuse me—— and she disappeared catherine had not found frederick he had been several days away and his intimate friend m deslauriers was now living in the provinces louise once more presented herself shaking all over without being able to utter a word she leaned against the furniture whats the matter with you tell me—whats the matter with you exclaimed her father she indicated by a wave of her hand that it was nothing and with a great effort of will she regained her composure the keeper of the restaurant at the opposite side of the street brought them soup but père roque had passed through too exciting an ordeal to be able to control his emotions he is not likely to die and at dessert he had a sort of fainting fit a doctor was at once sent for and he prescribed a potion then when m roque was in bed he asked to be as well wrapped up as possible in order to bring on perspiration he gasped he moaned thanks my good catherine kiss your poor father my chicken ah those revolutions and when his daughter scolded him for having made himself ill by tormenting his mind on her account he replied yes you are right but i couldnt help it i am too sensitive footnotes this is another political allusion flocon

2015,Little Toy Guns,Carrie Underwood,"[Verse 1]
In between the coats in the closet
She held on to that heart shaped locket
Staring at a family flawless
But it ain't a pretty picture tonight
Mom and daddy just wouldn't stop it
Fighting at the drop of a faucet
Cuts through the walls catastrophic
She's caught in the crossfire (Crossfire)
Puts her hands over her ears
Starts talking through her tears
She's sayin', and she's prayin'

[Chorus]
I wish words were like little toy guns
No sting, no hurt, no one
Just a bang bang rollin' off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
Yeah, no smoke, no bullets
No kick from the trigger when you pull it
No pain, no damage done
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
And just a bang bang rollin' off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)

[Verse 2]
Wish there was a white flag waving
Or that they were both just faking
And it was just a game they were playing like shoot 'em up cowboys
Leave the plastic pistols in the front yard
Throw away the score card and just turn off all the noise

I wish words were like little toy guns
No sting, no hurt, no one
Just a bang bang rollin' off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
Yeah, no smoke, no bullets
No kick from the trigger when you pull it
No pain, no damage done
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
And just a bang bang rollin' off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)

[Bridge]
Toy guns
Ohh, I wish they didn't cut like a knife (Like a knife)
I wish they didn't break you inside (Break you inside)
I wish they didn't bang bang make you wanna run, yeah

[Chorus]
Like little toy guns
No sting, no hurt, no one
Just a bang bang rollin' off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
Yeah, no smoke, no bullets
No shot from the trigger when you pull it
No pain, no damage done
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
And just a bang bang rollin' off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)

2015,FourFiveSeconds,Rihanna & Kanye West & Paul McCartney,"[Verse 1: Rihanna]
I think I've had enough
I might get a little drunk
I say what's on my mind
I might do a little time
'Cause all of my kindness
Is taken for weakness

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Now I'm four, five seconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm just tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would tell me
Ooh, that's all I want
[Verse 2: Kanye West & Paul McCartney]
Woke up an optimist
Sun was shinin', I'm positive
We can run
Then I heard you was talkin' trash
I'm on a mystery
Hold me back, I'm 'bout to spaz

[Chorus: Rihanna & Kanye West]
Yeah, I'm 'bout four, five seconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would try me
Ooh, that’s all I want
You might also like[Bridge: Rihanna]
And I know that you're up tonight
Thinkin', ""How could I be so selfish?""
But you called 'bout a thousand times
Wondering where I've been
Now I know that you're up tonight
Thinkin', ""How could I be so reckless?""
But I just can't apologize
I hope you can understand, yeah

[Verse 3: Kanye West with Rihanna]
If I go to jail tonight
Promise you'll pay my bail
See they want to buy my pride
But that just ain't up for sale
See all of my kindness (Mhm)
Is taken for weakness

[Chorus: Rihanna & Kanye West]
Now I'm four, five seconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'

Lay back and smell the sun warm up the Georgia pine
Feels so good to be takin' it easy

Got a good lookin' woman with her arms 'round me
Here, in a small town, where it feels like home

2015,Love You Like That,Canaan Smith,"[Verse 1]
Hey girl, I’m just a small town run around
I get my kicks out on the outskirts of town
I could never do it like a pretty city boy
I’m more a fishin’ in the dark nitty gritty boy
So lay back and let me paint you a picture
The way I wanna kiss you is

[Chorus]
Slow as the Mississippi
Strong as a fifth of whiskey
Steady as a Tom Petty track
I wanna love, wanna love you like that
Deeper than a sunset sky
Sweeter than muscadine wine
All night ‘til the sun comes back
I wanna love, wanna love, wanna love you like that

[Verse 2]
When I’m with you I can see down the road girl
Not just the gravel one we’re travelin’ on girl
And I’m bettin’ that it’s gonna be a wild ride
But I promise that I’m gonna be there by your side
I think we got another memory in the makin’
So baby let’s take it, take it

Damn you really turn me on painting your toenails pink

2015,Wet Dreamz,J. Cole,"[Intro]
Cole
Cole world
Yeah
Let me take y'all back, man
As I do so well
Wadn't nuttin' like that
Man, it wadn't nuttin' like that

[Verse 1]
First time, she was in my math class (Uh-huh)
Long hair, brown skin with the fat ass
Sat beside me, used to laugh, had mad jokes
The teacher always got mad, so we passed notes
It started off so innocent
She had a vibe and a nigga started diggin' it, uh
I was a youngin, straight crushin', tryna play the shit cool
But a nigga couldn't wait to get to school, ‘cause when I seen
Them thighs on her and them hips on her and them lips on her
Got me daydreamin', man, what
I'm thinkin' how she rides on it, if she sits on it, if she licks on it
Make it hard for me to stand up, as time goes by
Attractions gettin' deep and
Wet dreamin', thinkin' that I'm smashin' but I'm sleepin', I want it bad
And I ain't never been obsessed before
She wrote a note that said, ""You ever had sex before?"" Damn…
You might also like[Chorus]
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no

[Verse 2]
I wrote back and said
""Of course I had sex before,"" knowin' I was frontin'
I said, ""I'm like a pro, baby,"" knowin' I was stuntin'
But if I told the truth, I knew that I'd get played out, son
Hadn't been in pussy since the day I came out one, but
She don't know that, so she done wrote back and told me
""Oh, you a pro, homie? Well, I want you to show me
My mama gone for the weekend
So Saturday, baby, we can get to freakin'.""
That's when my heart start racin' and my body start sweatin'
Baby, you done woke my lil' man up
I'm thinkin' how that body look naked when you layin' on the bed
Teacher, please, don't make me stand up, I wrote back like
""Yeah, baby, sound like a plan.""
Still tryna play it cool, sound like the man
But I was scared to death, my nigga, my stomach turnin'
Talkin' shit, knowin' damn well I was a virgin, fuck
[Chorus]
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no

[Verse 3]
Yeah, you know that feelin' when you
Know you finna bone for the first time?
I'm hopin' that she won't notice it's my first time
I'm hopin' that my shit is big enough to fuck wit'
And most of all I'm prayin', ""God, don't let me bust quick""
I'm watchin' pornos, tryna see just how to stroke right
Practice puttin' condoms on—how it go? Right
I'm in her crib, now a nigga palm sweatin'
With a pocket full of rubbers and an erection
That's when my hands start touchin' and her face start blushin'
And a nigga roll over on top and then she
Get my pants unbuckled and her hands start rubbin'
On me, ooh girl, don't stop, it's time for action
Pull out the condoms real smooth, yeah, just how I practiced
But right before I put it in, she flinched and grabbed it and said
""I wanna get somethin' off my mental
I can tell you're a pro, but baby, be gentle, ‘cause—""
[Chorus]
‘Cause I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
I ain't never did this before, no

Preacher said he died too young
Over there totin' that gun
For Uncle Sam and our freedom
Mom and Daddy dressed in black
They folded up that flag
Handed it to dad
And started prayin'

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, he went out
Twenty-one guns blazin'

[Chorus]
That's one hell of an Amen
That's the only way to go
Fightin' the good fight
'Til the good Lord calls you home
So, be well, my friend
'Til I see you again
This is our last goodbye
But it's a hell of an Amen

[Verse 2]
Doctor said he ain't got long
He just smiled and said bring it on
Well, if you think I'm scared
You got me all wrong, naw

We all hit our knees

2015,The Matrimony,Wale Featuring Usher,"[Skit: Jerry Seinfeld & Wale]
Seinfeld: Getting engaged is like getting, uh, it's the first hill of the roller coaster
And you hear those clickers, the loud sound - this really violent, metal
'Chunka-chunka-chunka' and you go, ""What, what's going on here,"" You know?
""Boy this thing is really, really goes high!""
Wale: I'm looking down, 'Oh shit!'
Seinfeld: And then you go over the top, the wedding is at the top. You go over the top, is the wedding and then you're just screaming
Wale: Even if you make plans you never think you're really ready for marriage?
Seinfeld: No it's uh, it's like any growth. You're no- you can't be ready for it because tha- it's growth, it's gonna be new. It's gonna be new. You're gonna have a new life, you're gonna be a new person

[Intro: Usher]
Couldn't make you wait forever, for forever
This is forever
I got you

[Chorus: Usher]
If there's a question of my heart, you've got it
It don't belong to anyone but you
If there's a question of my love, you've got it
Baby, don't worry, I've got plans for you
Baby, I've been making plans, oh love
Baby, I've been making plans for you
Baby, I've been making plans
Baby, I've been making plans for you

[Verse 1: Wale]
(My sincerest apologies, I mean it)
Look, I'll admit it, albeit pathetic
That I'm in my late 20s, still never been to a wedding
Guess the idea of that lobby empty do not sit with me well
It’s not your fault they try get me cause I'ma need the sales
Cause I'm selfish, and I need you to myself
Tryna see you afloat, but don't wanna see you excel
Cause I failed and see you 'bout to cry
Cause when I enter they city they leave without they pride
I'm sorry, and you starin' at my comments
Fearin' it's gone always be you sharin' me with all them
Wrong, how dare I say ignore them?
Preparing for that day I leave you here and switch you for them
It's hard, you know temptation and all
Bitches out here tryna see if my relationship's strong
Get a place in the charts or runaway from your heart
Gave this music my all, nothing is sacred no more - I'm wrong
See Wale LiveGet tickets as low as $33You might also like[Pre-Chorus 1: Wale]
But I'm promisin' you better though
And your friends sayin', ""let him go""
And we ain't gettin' any younger
I can give up now, but I can promise you forever though

[Chorus: Usher]
If there's a question of my heart, you've got it
It don't belong to anyone but you
If there's a question of my love, you've got it
Baby, don't worry, I've got plans for you
Baby, I've been making plans, oh love
Baby, I've been making plans for you
Baby, I've been making plans
Baby, I've been making plans for you

[Verse 2: Wale]
(Realest shit I ever wrote, realest shit I ever wrote
Realest shit I ever wrote, if you ever knew love)
I’ll admit it, let me be hypothetic
The day I find a woman I prolly be scared to share it
The idea of me finding love, would run somebody off
And true my wall could use some plaques, but still I gotta floss
Brush you off, see I'm kinda lost
Now I'm up in the club with a couple of move ons
And dark, good nigga, troubled heart
Went from fallin' in love to drunk and fallin' apart
This is hard, tryna find some time to move on
Cause when we lost our baby, I got shady, shit got too dark
Soft, and I thank you baby, you strong
My ex before you married too, you solo, I say so long
Nah, good terms how that ended
But it surely put a dent on how I worry about this business
Off white picket fences, on flights with the children
On site stealin' kisses on off nights my intentions but
[Pre-Chorus 2: Wale]
But I plan to do it better though
But you still sayin' let it go
We ain't gettin' any younger
Women love me now but in your eyes we forever though

[Chorus: Usher]
If there's a question of my heart, you've got it
It don't belong to anyone but you
If there's a question of my love, you've got it
Baby, don't worry, I've got plans for you
Baby, I've been making plans, oh baby
I've been making plans, oh love
Baby, I've been making plans for you
Baby, I've been making plans
Baby, I've been making plans for you

[Outro: Wale]

2015,El Perdon (Forgiveness),Nicky Jam & Enrique Iglesias,"[Verse 1: Enrique & Nicky]
I know you moved on
I heard you're doing better without me
Girl, this is driving me crazy
Can't you see what you're doing to me?
She let go
She killed me when she said it was over
Now I'm in the middle of nowhere
And got no space to breathe

[Pre-Chorus: Enrique & Nicky]
I'm missing you, baby
Up all night, going crazy
Now my angel can't save me
Oh, no
I'm missing you, baby
Up all night, going crazy
Drinking my pain away

[Chorus: Enrique & Nicky]
Girl, I'm not with you
You're not with me
And I don't like the way it feels
Esto no me gusta
Esto no me gusta
Girl, I'm not with you

Can't take the pain
Can't take the hurt
I wish that I could turn back time and say I love you
I'd do anything to make it work, oh
'Cause even through the times they tried to hate on us
The only thing that mattered to me was our love
Never will I stop, I'll never get enough

[Pre-Chorus: Enrique & Nicky]
I'm missing you, baby
Up all night, going crazy
Now my angel can't save me
Oh, no
I'm missing you, baby

But I'm begging you, please don't go
No, I don't wanna let you go, oh, no, huh
Yeah you know that I want you back
Baby, I love you to the max
From here to the moon and back

Callin' shots, refereein', no drama
Pussy so wet, I'ma need Dramamine, mattress Aquafining

Swimmin' with the dolphins on the Dan Marino
Wine mixin', this shit like the Catalina
B-I-G, minus Puff and Lil Cease
I'm on my grind, 3 AM text like I need ya
Dream about the pussy, fuck it, I'm a dreamer
Hold me down, but don't hold me back like I need you to, damn
I wrote myself a million-dollar check in fifth grade (Fifth grade)
I put it on the wall and promised it'd be this way (This way)
She fuck me like she want the rent paid
Like she want that Oscar De La Renta
I slow it down like it's her favorite ballad
Then go back up at it like I hadn't had it
Straight up

I see these bitches in Supperclub
Niggas got me throwin' bottles up
Bottles with all of my homies
I'm feelin' generous, throwin' my money
She said she wanted the molly love
I gave her the dick, but I'm not in love
I call out, ""Bingo"" the minute I'm bonin'
Soon as I'm done, kick her out in the mornin'
Got Xans when I turn up, it's a party, bust it open
Pop that pussy in a circle, go retarded, pop it for me
She got that booty galore, grippin' it, backin' me up
You wanna fuck with a thug
Now I see all these bitches got ass and they throwin'
Damn, it's just a matter of time 'fore I'm gone
Drinkin' CÎROC and I know that she got it for free
I hit up Diddy, he told me he did it
He said that the liquor just bring out the freaks
Them bitches lit, droppin' that ass to a split
Talkin' 'bout me, I'm the shit
I just get down for the money, the bitches, and cars
And my niggas, they whippin' the bricks, huh

2015,King Kunta,Kendrick Lamar,"[Produced by Sounwave; Additional production by Terrace Martin]
[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
I got a bone to pick
I don't want you monkey-mouth motherfuckers
Sittin' in my throne again
Ayy, ayy, nigga, what's happenin'?
K-Dot back in the hood, nigga!
I'm mad (He mad!), but I ain't stressin'
True friends, one question

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
When you got the yams—(What's the yams?)

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
The yam is the power that be
You can smell it when I'm walkin' down the street
(Oh yes, we can, oh yes, we can)
I can dig rappin', but a rapper with a ghostwriter?
What the fuck happened? (Oh no!)
I swore I wouldn't tell, but most of y'all sharing bars
Like you got the bottom bunk in a two-man cell (A two-man cell)
Something's in the water (Something's in the water)
And if I gotta brown-nose for some gold
Then I'd rather be a bum than a motherfuckin' baller (Oh yeah!)

Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
King Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
When you got the yams—(What's the yams?)

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
The yam brought it out of Richard Pryor
Manipulated Bill Clinton with desires
Twenty-four-seven, three-sixty-five days times two
I was contemplatin' gettin' off stage
Just to go back to the hood, see my enemy, and say… (Oh yeah)

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
You goat-mouth mammyfucker
I was gonna kill a couple rappers, but they did it to themselves
Everybody's suicidal, they ain't even need my help
This shit is elementary, I'll probably go to jail
If I shoot at your identity and bounce to the left
Stuck a flag in my city, everybody's screamin', ""Compton!""
I should probably run for mayor when I'm done, to be honest
And I put that on my momma and my baby boo too
Twenty million walkin' out the court buildin', woo-woo!
Aw, yeah, fuck the judge
I made it past twenty-five, and there I was
A little nappy-headed nigga with the world behind him
Life ain't shit but a fat vagina
Screamin', ""Annie, are you okay? Annie, are you okay?""
Limo tinted with the gold plates
Straight from the bottom, this the belly of the beast
From a peasant to a prince to a motherfuckin' king (Oh yeah)

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'—*Gunshot*
By the time you hear the next pop
The funk shall be within you—*Gunshot*
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
King Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
[Outro: Kendrick Lamar & Whitney Alford]

2015,Crash And Burn,Thomas Rhett,"[Verse 1]
So I guess it's over, baby, déjà vu again
Who'd have thought that time don't stop?
And somehow, girl, the world keeps spinnin'
And guess I've turned myself into a solitary man
Ain't like I'm the only one that's in the shoes that I am

[Chorus]
Do you hear that? (Do you hear that?)
I'm right back (I'm right back)
At the sound of lonely callin'
Do you hear that? (Do you hear that?)
It's where I'm at (It's where I'm at)
It's the sound of teardrops fallin' down, down
A slammin' door and a lesson learned
I let another lover crash and burn

[Verse 2]
I know that it might sound jaded and I have to say
I think love is overrated, but I don't like throwin' it away
I know you could probably tell me right where I went wrong
Some guys can't have all the luck if others don't sing sad songs

[Chorus]
Do you hear that? (Do you hear that?)
I'm right back (I'm right back)
At the sound of lonely callin'
Do you hear that? (Do you hear that?)
It's where I'm at (It's where I'm at)
It's the sound of teardrops fallin' down, down
A slammin' door and a lesson learned
I let another lover crash and burn, that's right

Was it all just pretend back then when
You said you loved me for me?
Cause lately it seems the girl of your dreams
Is someone that I can't be
Oh but I try
And oh I cry

Oh baby I've tried
But this is my life
Boy you want me to change
Baby I'll change, my mind

Well I used to believe you knew better than me
But now I'm the one in control
And I might make mistakes but I'll make 'em my way

2015,She Don't Love You,Eric Paslay,"[Verse 1]
She don't love you, she's just lonely
She wasn't once upon a time
She used to dance when the band played
She used to be the trustin' kind

[Verse 2]
She's no stranger to the leavin'
She's heard all the best goodbyes
Fallin' has a different meanin'
To her, you're just another guy

[Chorus]
She don't love you, she's just lonely
She don't know another way
To break free from what's been broken
Too many cowboys rode away
So forgive her if she's distant
She can't tell her heart to lie, no
You'll never be her one and only
She don't love you, she's just lonely
Yeah

You can hold her in the moonlight
You can give her all the stars
You can promise her forever, oh

You ain't got a dress that I don't like
You ain't got a pair of jeans that don't fit you just right
There's not a minute in the day
That you don't knock me out, you don't blow me away

But, girl, now that the sun's gone down (whoa-oh-oh)
Looking at you right here and now, baby

Something about that southern sky
Sitting back behind that moon
It goes perfect with your eyes
Girl, tonight looks good on you
It's something about the way you're smiling
Making the stars fall right on queue

Tonight looks good on you

2015,Crushin' It,Brad Paisley,"[Verse 1]
I sure could use an attaboy or a big old high five
I'd love to hear ""You're killing it, dude"", yeah, it's been a long time
Since I hit one out of the park, or nailed it as they say
I guess I've been in a dry spell but that's about to change

[Chorus]
'Cause every week has a weekend, by this time Friday night
I'll be done with my third can of cold Bud Light
And I'll be crushin' it, yeah, I'll be crushin' it

[Verse 2]
They say your baby's mad cause you told her that you'd hang some pictures for her
You know the ones she framed late last spring of you and her in Florida
You're up on the ladder when it shatters into smithereens
She shakes her head, looks at you and says
""Ain't you good for anything?"" and you say

[Chorus]
Every week has a weekend, by this time Friday night
You want a margarita, I'll get Tequila and ice
And I'll be crushin' it, with a cold one in my other hand
I'll be crushin' it, when I'm finished with my can
I can stomp it with my boot, clench it with my fist
Smash it on my forehead, yeah I got this
I'll be crushin' it, oh, I'll be crushin' it
Oh

I figured this out in college, walking past them Gothic columns
That I was gonna probably wind up somewhere near the bottom
I was never gonna be the best and brightest guy around
But like the great George freakin Strait, I'm the king of getting unwound

[Chorus]
And every week has a weekend, by this time Friday night
I'll be done with my third can of cold Bud Light
And I'll be crushin' it, every weekend's a weekend
Yeah, I'll be crushin' it, by this time Friday night

2015,Stressed Out,Twenty One Pilots,"[Verse 1]
I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang
I was told, when I get older, all my fears would shrink
But now I'm insecure, and I care what people think

[Pre-Chorus]
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

[Chorus]
Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out (Oh)
Wish we could turn back time (Oh) to the good old days (Oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
We're stressed out

[Verse 2]
Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's comin' from?
I'd make a candle out of it, if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one
It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
Same clothes, homegrown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and treehouse homes, we all would take the latter

No way it was our last night I kissed your lips
Make you grip the sheets with your fingertips

But I'm still gon' wake up wantin' you and me

[Verse 2]
No way it was the last night that we break up
I see your tail lights in the dust
You call your mama, I call your bluff
In the middle of the night, pull it right back up
Yeah, my, my friends say, ""Let her go""
Your friends say, ""What the hell?""
I wouldn't trade your kind of love for nothin' else

2023,Kill Bill,SZA,"[Verse 1]
I'm still a fan even though I was salty
Hate to see you with some other broad, know you happy
Hate to see you happy if I'm not the one drivin'

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm so mature, I'm so mature
I'm so mature, I got me a therapist to tell me there's other men
I don't want none, I just want you
If I can't have you, no one should

[Chorus]
I might
I might kill my ex, not the best idea
His new girlfriend's next, how'd I get here?
I might kill my ex, I still love him though
Rather be in jail than alone

[Verse 2]
I get the sense that it's a lost cause
I get the sense that you might really love her
This text gon' be evidence, this text is evidence
I tried to ration with you, no murders or crime of passion, but damn
You was out of reach
You was at the farmer's market with your perfect peach
Now I'm in the basement plannin' home invasion
Now you layin' face-down, got me singin' over a beat

Who can make you face what you're guardin'
Open up the gates where your heart is
And just be yourself (ADELSO on this)

I say, ""You look good without no make-up, no lashes, even better when you wake up"" (Oh, oh, oh)

[Verse 1: Toosii]
I see the look on your face, I see you're hidin' the hate
I see you're lookin' for someone to scoop you right off of your feet
You want to ride in the Wraith
You want to go out on dates
You want somebody to come bring you flowers
Someone to talk to for hours
Wash your back while y'all sit in the shower (Yeah)
Someone to tell you, ""You're beautiful""
Someone to tell you and mean it
Someone to tell you, ""I love you"" everyday and don't got a reason
You want someone to bring you peace (Uh)
Someone to help you sleep (Yeah)
Someone to pick you up when you're feelin' down, feelin' lonely

I'm The Voice, but the system ain't give me a choice
Know some people that's still unemployed
I know a felon who tryna get FOID
Child support your only support
For a visit, I'm goin' through courts
Went to jail, they was chainin' me up
And you know that I'm famous as fuck

First-generation ghetto nigga
Cole world, hello niggas
Made it out the city with my head on straight
Niggas keep shootin' up the lead out
Young Jordan Peele, gotta get out
And the shit that I spit out
Is a cheat code like I'm facin' a RICO
And how a nigga put a hit out
And another one, and, and another one
I got like a hundred of 'em
'Bout to lap niggas so they think they ahead of me
But I'm really in front of them
Now some of them fumblin' they bags
Fuckin' up the little crumbs that they had
A reminder to humble yourself
This shit could be gone in an instant
Me, I'm runnin' long distance, all pistons firin'
I been stuck between maybe retirin'
And feelin' like I'm just not hittin' my prime
These days seein' rappers be dyin'
Way before they even gettin' they shine
I never even heard of lil' buddy
'Til somebody murdered lil' buddy
Now I'm on the phone, searchin' lil' buddy name
Got to playin' his tunes
All day in my room, thinkin', ""Damn
This shit wicked, to get they names buzzin'
Some niggas just gotta go lay in a tomb""
And media thirsty for clicks
I got a new rule
If you ain't never posted a rapper when he was alive
You can't post about him after he get hit
It's simple, it's the principle
On any tempo, I'm invincible
Don't even rap, I just vent to you
I rather that than an interview most days
Fuck 'em all like I'm goin' through a ho phase
Young nigga shoot out the whip like road rage
I pray all of my dawgs stay so paid
And the only thing that kill 'em is old age

2023,Creepin',"Metro Boomin, The Weeknd & 21 Savage","[Intro]
(Just can't believe this, man)
(Metro Boomin want some more, nigga)
[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
Somebody said they saw you
The person you were kissing wasn't me
And I would never ask you
I just kept it to myself

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
I don't wanna know
If you're playin' me, keep it on the low
'Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you creepin', please don't let it show
Oh, baby, I don't wanna know

[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
I think about it when I hold you
When lookin' in your eyes, I can't believe
And I don't need to know the truth
Baby, keep it to yourself

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
I don't wanna know
If you're playin' me, keep it on the low
'Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you creepin', please don't let it show
Oh, baby, I don't wanna know

Did he touch you better than me? (Touch you better than me)
Did he watch you fall asleep? (Watch you fall asleep)
Did you show him all those things that you used to do to me?
If you're better off that way (Better off that way)
There ain't more that I can say (More that I can say)
Just go on and do your thing and don't come back to me

[Verse 3: 21 Savage]
Woah, woah, woah, 21
Had me crushin', I was cuffin' like the precinct
How you go from housewife to a sneaky link?
Got you riding 'round in all type of Benzes and Rovers
Girl, you used to ride in the rinky-dink
I'm the one put you in Eliantte (On God)
Fashion Nova model, I put you on the runway (On God)
You was rockin' Coach bags, got you Chane'-ne'
Side bitch in Frisco, I call her my Bay-bae (21)
I got a girl, but I still feel alone (On God)
If you playin' me that mean my home ain't home (On God)
Havin' nightmares of goin' through your phone (21)
Can't even record, you got me out my zone

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
I don't wanna know
If you're playin' me, keep it on the low
'Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you creepin', please don't let it show
Oh, baby, I don't wanna know
If you're playin' me, keep it on the low
'Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you creepin', please don't let it show
Oh, baby, I don't wanna know
[Outro: 21 Savage & The Weeknd]
If you creepin', just don't let me find out (On God)
Get a hotel, never bring 'em to the house (On God)
If you're better off that way

2023,Fast Car,Luke Combs,"[Verse 1]
You got a fast car
And I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Startin' from zero, got nothin' to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me, myself, I got nothin' to prove

[Verse 2]
You got a fast car
And I got a plan to get us out of here
I've been workin' at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just across thе border and into the city
And you and I can both get jobs
Finally see what it mеans to be livin'

[Verse 3]
See, my old man's got a problem
He live in the bottle, that's the way it is
He said his body's too old for working
His body's too young to look like his
So Mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said, ""Somebody's gotta take care of him""
So I quit school and that's what I did
See Luke Combs LiveGet tickets as low as $63You might also like[Refrain]
You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
Still gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way

[Chorus]
So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us and your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

[Verse 4]
You got a fast car
We go cruising, entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
So I work in the market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
And we'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house, live in the suburbs

[Chorus]
So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us and your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone
[Verse 5]
You got a fast car
I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinking late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together you and me would find it
I got no plans, I ain't goin' nowhere
Take your fast car and keep on driving

[Chorus]
So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us and your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

2023,Anti-Hero,Taylor Swift,"[Verse 1]
I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room

[Pre-Chorus]
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
(Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
(For the last time)

[Chorus]
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

[Verse 2]
Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed

Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman?

2023,"Boy's A Liar, Pt. 2",PinkPantheress & Ice Spice,"[Verse 1: PinkPantheress]
Take a look inside your heart, is there any room for me?
I won't have to hold my breath till you get down on one knee
Because you only want to hold me when I'm looking good enough
Did you ever feel me? Would you ever picture us?
Every time I pull my hair, well, it's only out of fear
That you'll find me ugly and one day you'll disappear because
What's the point of crying? It was never even love
Did you ever want me? Was I ever good enough?

[Chorus: PinkPantheress]
Thе-the boy's a liar, the boy's a liar
He doеsn't see ya, you're not looking at me, boy
The boy's a liar, the boy's a liar

So I tell him there's one of me, he makin' fun of me (Ha-ha)
His girl is a bum to me (Grrah)
Like that boy is a cap
Sayin' he home, but I know where he at, like
Bet he blowin' her back
Thinkin' 'bout me 'cause he know that it's fat (Damn)
And it been what it been (Huh)
Callin' his phone like, ""Yo, send me a pin""
Duckin' my shit, 'cause he know what I'm on (Grrah)
But when he hit me, I'm not gon' respond (Grrah)
But I don't sleep enough without you
And I can't eat enough without you (Huh)

But when you place your head between my collar and jaw
I don't know much, but there's no weight at all

To you, I'm just a man; to me, you're all I am
Where the hell am I supposed to go?

Holdin' me back
Gravity's holdin' me back
I want you to hold out the palm of your hand
Why don't we leave it at that?
Nothin' to say
When everything gets in the way
Seems you cannot be replaced
And I'm the one who will stay, oh-oh-oh

In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was

Answer the phone
""Harry, you're no good alone
Why are you sitting at home on the floor?

Don't feel bad for you but I feel bad for him
And all the hell you gon' be puttin' him through

Probably tell him that I ain't been on your mind
How I ain't nothin' but a long gone thing
You can cuss my name, but baby, don't you lie

When you're tasting what he's drinking, are you thinkin' 'bout me?
When you're ridin' where he's drivin', are you missin' my street?

2023,Karma,Taylor Swift Featuring Ice Spice,"[Verse 1]
You're talking shit for the hell of it
Addicted to betrayal, but you're relevant
You're terrified to look down
'Cause if you dare, you'll see the glare
Of everyone you burned just to get there
It's coming back around

[Pre-Chorus]
And I keep my side of the street clean
You wouldn't know what I mean

[Chorus]
'Cause karma is my boyfriend
Karma is a god
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend
Karma's a relaxing thought
Aren't you envious that for you it's not?
Sweet like honey, karma is a cat
Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat
Me and karma vibe like that

[Verse 2]
Spiderboy, king of thieves
Weave your little webs of opacity
My pennies made your crown
Trick me once, trick me twice
Don't you know that cash ain't the only price?

I know it's a bad idea
But how can I help myself?
Been inside for most this year
And I thought a few drinks, they might help
It's been a while, my dear
Dealin' with the cards life dealt
I'm still holdin' back these tears
While my friends are somewhere else

[Pre-Chorus]
I pictured this year a little bit different when it hit February
I step in the bar, it hit me so hard, oh, how can it be this heavy?
Every song reminds me you're gone and I feel thе lump form in my throat
'Cause I'm here alonе

[Chorus]
Just dancin' with my eyes closed
'Cause everywhere I look, I still see you
And time is movin' so slow
And I don't know what else that I can do
So I'll keep dancin' with my

I can't help but missin' you (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

2023,Mourning,Post Malone,"[Chorus]
Don't wanna sober up
The sun is killin' my buzz, that's why they call it mourning
Thought I was strong enough
Threw my bottle at the sky, said, ""God, that's a warning""
Don't wanna sober up
Try to keep it inside, but I just wanna pour it
Thought I was strong enough
Got a lotta shit to say, couldn't fit it in the chorus

[Verse 1]
I just left Wally's, spent a Maserati
The way I gotta flex, you'd think I did Pilates
I call my quote-unquote friends, ""Do you got plans?""
Turns out everyone's free when the dinner is
Then they drag me to a party out in Malibu
After thirty High Noons, it was pretty cool
Tried to shoot my shot, she told me that she had a shoot
Bye-bye (Damn)

[Chorus]
Don't wanna sober up
The sun is killin' my buzz, that's why they call it mourning
Thought I was strong enough
Threw my bottle at the sky, said, ""God, that's a warning""
Don't wanna sober up
Try to keep it inside, but I just wanna pour it
Thought I was strong enough
Got a lotta shit to say, couldn't fit it in the chorus

Stumblin' down the corridor, came across an open door
Throwin' up is easy and who put on the Commodores?
That's a nice tile floor, wish I got to know you more
Who am I talkin' to? Nobody
Take me outside, I'm a little too high
Paid a little too much for the time of my life
When money ain't a problem, everyone's lyin'
Even when I tell myself that I

Your old apartment, is y'all's new place
There goes the carpet but the deer head stays

[Chorus]
Next thing you know
You're savin' money like never before, just to
Spend it all at a jewelry store
Gettin' down on one knee on hеr mama's porch
Just prayin' she don't say, ""No""
Next thing you know
Your best man givеs a half-drunk speech and you're
Sunburnt on a honeymoon beach and your
Left hand's gettin' used to that ring
And there the next two or three years go
Next thing you know

[Verse 2]
You weren't really tryin', next thing you know
There's a test on the counter, next thing you know
She's standin' there cryin', noddin' her head yes
You're half excited, half scared to death

Mama, I'm callin', I've got some news

Just never thought I'd see the day

He opens the door and he don't make me cry

And I wore the hat on his dash to the game
It sure wasn't Athens, but I
Fell for him under those Neyland lights

2023,Love You Anyway,Luke Combs,"[Verse 1]
If your kiss turned me to stone
I'd be a statue standing tall in ancient Rome
And if your touch shattered me like glass
I’d be in pieces trying to make the breaking last

[Pre-Chorus]
If it took one look to turn my days to night
At least I'd have the stars that sparkle in your eyes

[Chorus]
There's just some things that leave a man no choice
Like a compass needle needing its true North
Even if I knew the day we met you’d be the reason this heart breaks
Oh, I'd love you anyway

[Verse 2]
I know just tryin' to write a song
I run the risk that I could get your perfect wrong
And well, I guess what I'm tryin' to say
Is there ain't words been made could shoulder so much weight

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you turned your back on me and walked away
Not a thing about the way I feel would change

Give me your lovin' (BanBwoi, I want your love)
Give me your lovin' (Woah, give me your lovin')

[Verse 1: 21 Savage]
I got feelings for you
Hope you ain't lovin' the crew
How many bodies you got?
Pray it ain't more than a few
Know that you dealt with some lames
When you was young and in school
He had to pop your cherry
But I got it wet like a pool
She got a new G-Wag'
She wanna hit Highlight Room and show it off
Got a new body, girl, show it off
This a Brazilian, I know it's soft
Toned up and she got a six-pack
Look like she used to play volleyball
American Express, you can have it all
Code to the safe, you can have it all
Fuck your main pagе, what's your Finsta? I wanna know the real you
You started dancin' to pay your tuition, girl, I wanna know what you been through
You want a boutiquе or you wanna sell hair, just let me know what you into

So I gotta respect ya
Niggas put hands on you in the past, insecure because your body is precious
Four words when I think about them is crusty, musty, dusty, rusty
Eight words when I think about us is fuck me, fuck me, fuck me, fuck me
Disrespect ya and I'll smack 'em
The texts that you send in captions
The videos we got ever leak, we goin' viral or goin' platinum
Don't worry 'bout your friend's story when I had her alone
She gon' try and put some extras on it, take you out of your zone
You know how it goes when they can't get a reservation up in Carbone
They gon' tell you it's a chill night, tell you how they'd rather stay home, yeah
Jealous-ass hoes, yeah
And I know what I said 'bout bein' in Vogue
But just like that R&B group from the '90s
Girl, one call, I'll get you in Vogue
One call, you in runway shows
One call, I'm sittin' front row
One wrong call from your ex nigga sayin' dumb shit'll get him sent home
One call and my niggas ten toes
Down to go wherever I say go
Even if we gotta travel 'cross the globe
Down to take you to the end of the road, for real
[Chorus: Drake]

I went lookin' at pictures I didn't wanna see
They brought back memories
You look happy, I guess, got the life that you wanted
But it ain't with me
You would think by now that I wouldn't care
It's been a couple years and, yeah, I've had my share
Of other broken-up hearts, but I only shed real tears over ours

[Chorus]
And now I'm in this cold bright light
And this don't even feel like life
'Cause I don't have the only woman who believed in me
Religiously
And now I'm in the back of the church
Prayin' just to stop the hurt
'Cause I don't have the only woman who was there for me
Religiously

[Verse 2]
Remember watchin' you play me our song on guitar
I thought I'd marry you
Act like I'm happier now, but all of my friends know
That ain't the truth
And lately life's been good to me
Mama's healthy and I'm helpin' out the whole family
Lotta people know my name, I made a little change
But that don't mean nothin'

2023,Daylight,David Kushner,"[Verse 1]
Telling myself I won't go there
Oh, but I know that I won't care
Tryna wash away all the blood I've spilt
This lust is a burden that we both share
Two sinners can't atone from a lone prayer
Souls tied, intertwined by pride and guilt

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ooh) There's darkness in the distance
From the way that I've been livin'
(Ooh) But I know I can't resist it
[Chorus]
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
You and I drink the poison from the same vine
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
Hidin' all of our sins from the daylight
From the daylight, runnin' from thе daylight
From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight
Oh, I love it and I hatе it at the same time

[Verse 2]
Tellin' myself it's the last time
Can you spare any mercy that you might find
If I'm down on my knees again?
Deep down, way down, Lord, I try
Try to follow your light, but it's nighttime
Please don't leave me in the end

You live in my dream state
Any time I count sheep
That's the only time we make up, make up
You exist behind my eyelids, my eyelids
Now, I don't wanna wake up

[Pre-Chorus: Tyler, The Creator, with Kali Uchis]
20/20, 20/20 vision
Cupid hit me, cupid hit me with precision, eye
Wonder if you look both ways when you cross my mind
I said, I said
I'm sick of, sick of, sick of, sick of chasing
You're the one that's always running through my daydreams, I
I can only see your face when I close my eyes
So...
[Chorus: Kali Uchis & Tyler, The Creator]
Can I get a kiss?
And can you make it last forever?

Stop the waiting 'fore I stop the chasing, like an alcoholic
""You don't understand me""—what the fuck do you mean?

Sugar-honey iced tea, bumblebee on the scene
Yeah, I'd give up my bakery to have a piece of your pie

Mabu get money while he pee
Shout out my label, that's me
I own a hundred percent of my cuts
Bitch, nobody takin' a fee
3.141592653
I'm the king of NYC
I heard they send my music to police
So this is a message to NYPD
I cap in my raps, I'm an innocent tweep
Keep a teddy bear when I sleep
I'm rappin' the words, but they write it for me
Me? I'm all about keepin' the peace
I mean, at least I get paid 'cause a lot of these rappers be cappin' for free
They call me The Ock
I got the bread, she chopped but said, ""Can I bring a friend?""
Never, never, never, I guess she forgot the bev', like
Two fives don't equal a ten
Quick math, don't try it again
She shaped like a turtle or a hen
Her makeup is fucked, she don't know how to blend
Make her do Wordle
She need to have brains if she givin' out head
Call her Virgil
'Cause the way she be blowin' shit got me dead
Haha, shawty got arctan
I wanna intersect her circle
She like, ""Mabu, I like purple""
So I blew her back out and I left her on read

Lil Mabu the king at switchin' the flow

2023,Human,Cody Johnson,"[Verse 1]
I thought by now I'd have it figured out
How not to make the easy thing so hard to do
I bet that I'd be further down this road
If I could read the signs that point me to the truth

[Verse 2]
I never planned on being nothin' but a cowboy
But somewhere I picked up this old guitar
Girl, all I can say is that I'm sorry
If I get kinda careless with your heart

[Chorus]
All the headlights, all the midnights
Chasin' all that empty, still ain't got it right
All the crazy all the gypsy
I guess all I'm sayin' is forgive me
If I don't know what I'm doin'
I'm still learnin' to be human

[Verse 3]
So far I've been good at burnin' bridges
Strike a match and ride right out of town
Bless your heart for nevеr tryin' to fix me
Or quit me or slow me down

Hey, Ms. Walker
Thank you for wantin' a verse from me
Apologies for the wait, sometimes, it's hard to-
Get the distractions up off ya
For enough time to jot your thoughts
But fuck it, this mornin' I gots to
I'm thinkin' about ya
I heard you just had you another lil' baby, congratulations
I hope you got through it with no complications
I find it amazing the way that you juggle your kids, the biz, the fame
The bitches that's hatin', they sit around waitin' for you to fall off, like the album I'm makin'
But I hope that you takin' a little time for yourself
Stealin' a moment or two to unwind
Between the hectic sounds of your precious baby cryin'
Do you clear your mind? Must be a lot goin' on
I hear it in all of your songs
Niggas been doin' you wrong
Family been doin' you wrong
On days you feelin' like you on your own
I wrote this for you to put on
Thank you for sharin' your light, your voice and writin' them beautiful poems
Session 32 bring me to tears, be gettin' choked up when I hear it
Seem like I keep cryin' off so much since a nigga had these kids
And I don't know what it is that made me so sensitive
More than I already was
But never mind that, I'm back, I'm sendin' you this little audio hug
In hopes that you smile, forgettin' the stress that piles from all the above
The more that we hurt, the harder we love
As soon as it's gone, we gotta re-up, it's just like a drug
If people knew half of the pressure, they'd know that it's hard to be her
I'm sendin' you, SZA & Ari my love
Y'all holdin' us down, y'all holdin' the crowns
You ever need somethin' from me, don't hesitate, please
Just hit me and I'll be around, I'm gone

2023,Fight The Feeling,Rod Wave,"[Intro]
Look, oh, woah
Uh, okay

[Verse]
Women, how'd you get so good at hiding your feelings?
Pretending, pretending you're fine when really you're bending
You can't keep patching up your pain taking shots at the bar
Know exactly how you feel, I know what's in your heart
Young nigga came a long way with so many scars
Finally found a brighter day from being lost in the dark
But she don't wanna hear that tonight (Oh no)
Play something that's feeling right (Oh no)
She tryna get lit tonight (Oh no)
Get lost in the city lights (Oh no)
Her heart still broken but she's in denial
She need her grandmama to watch her child
Her make-up covers up her broken smile
You're livin' on lies, hurtin' insidе but she's outside

[Chorus]
So get your hair did, put your clothеs on
Tell the DJ to play your song (Play your song)
Tryna fight the feeling, but she never finished healing
Now you in the middle of the club, tryin' not to cry to a love song
In the middle of the club, tryin' not to cry to a love song, woah
To a love song, woah, to a love song
Now you in the middle of the club, tryin' not to cry to a love song
To a love song (To a love song)
Uh, to a love song (To a love song)
Now you in the middle of the club, tryin' not to cry to a love song

We do the things, but we know it's wrong
All on my skin, you all in my palm

You possess venom, that came with a charm
You get the good out me when I perform
I know the bad in you, that's what I want
And you a baddie, you turnin' me on
Fiend for your demons, I know where this goin'
Love when you fuckin' me, talkin', I know what you doin'
Caught up in love, what the fuck is we doin'?
Models and bottles with us, ain't nothin' to it
I tell you, ""I got you,"" that's well understood
Your legs on the bed, got your head on the floor
We go out shoppin' whenever we get bored
We get it poppin', leave nothin' in the store
If I go to Saturn, I know that you goin'
Fuck me on Saturday, early in the mornin'
Flyer than a bird, she gon' open her door
Screamin' out murder, but showin' you remorse
Gotta be cautious, can't pay the support

I turned on my crew, bought a coupe off of verses
I'm tired of these strippers, I'm going at nurses and doctors and dentists
You started, I finished, I told you we with it

Team full of players, ain't nobody stopping us
He out of line, give a fuck, then we poppin' him
Been raisin' hell, back in school, I was popular, yeah
All of my hoes get facials, face me
Make her my bitch too much, she lazy
I was thinking prices too high, then I raised 'em
Shit in my bank account gettin' outrageous
Niggas smellin' like that, had to switch up my fragrance
And I'm sending out shots if the fouls get flagrant
Switch up my route to the house, had to change it
Still with the shit, I forget that I'm famous

2023,Go Hard,Lil Baby,"[Chorus]
I'm back goin' hard again, I'm shuttin' down my heart again
No one can get next to me, so they gotta put orders in
Try my best to act like I didn't care, but I can't hold it in and
I'm not into losin', I go hard as I can go to win
I'm back goin' hard again, I'm shuttin' down my heart again
No one can get next to me, so they gotta put orders in
Try my best to act like I didn't care, but I can't hold it in and
I'm not into losin', I go hard as I can go to win

[Verse 1]
You pillow talkin' to hoes again
You breakin' the code again
I'm on the road again
We snuck in this bitch with them poles again
This chopper do tricks, you gon' go fold it in
I know they be hatin', I still post they shit
We slid on they block like we 'posed to slid
This Glock been with me on my road to riches
We done over-sold the load again
Too many plays, been up for too many days
Boy, you a bitch, you got feminine ways
I get the drop, I'ma pay, they gon' spray where you stay
I had to check on my man, think he part of the Klan
Keep a mask, he got too many Ks
I had to run up them bands when I got out the can
Can't go back, I got too many cases
He actin' bad on the 'Gram, but we know what's gon' happen
It happen in every occasion
Somebody killed, I be tellin' my youngins to chill
Check the stats, I do numbers, for real
And this ain't no cap, I get money, for real
That lil' boy ain't run up no commas, for real
Don't play with Baby, I go million for million
I made it out, but yet I'm still in the field
Five hundred racks sittin' in my Urus
Ten carat diamonds spent in my earlobes
Superhero Baby, savin' the ghetto
If I'm not the man, I'm the man in the middle
Hop out the car with my hand on my pistol
He just a fan and he mad I don't feel him
I know they know that I ran with them killers
Fuck it, you know I still run with them guys
Drivebys a waste of my time, I want somebody to die
I risk it all, put my sack on the line
I came from the back of the line
We had it crackin' since back when lil' one was alive
You can go ask on my line
I wish Lil Woo would've never went through with his move
But I'm glad that he through with his dime, yeah

No one can get next to me, so they gotta put orders in
Try my best to act like I didn't care, but I can't hold it in and
I'm not into losin', I go hard as I can go to win

[Verse 2]
He tryna diss me, that shit ain't gon' get to me
I can't give pussy-ass niggas my energy
He say that shit when I see him, then he'll see
Know they mad 'cause they can't take a seat with me
Got the best of the best in the sheets with me
Hands down, can't nobody compete with me
I eat filet mignon, I'm a cash cow
I got ten million cash from my last album
I'm just waitin' on bronem to max out
Every show that I get, it be packed out
Five K for your teeth, you got ripped off
Spent a hundred thousand on mine
Crack a smile just to show the diamonds
From the corner to another continent
Got a baby daddy? I don't wanna hit
Need a Nike deal how I'm runnin' shit
He can't come to the A, he on punishment
Catch that boy out of place, we gon' punish him
Take his chain and his watch on some funny shit
Brodie ready to crash on some dummy shit
Gotta fuck me for free, ain't no money, bitch
I've been on some pimp shit lately
I been off a jet with some made men
We had twenty vibes out in Vegas
[Chorus]
I'm back goin' hard again, I'm shuttin' down my heart again
No one can get next to me, so they gotta put orders in
Try my best to act like I didn't care, but I can't hold it in and
I'm not into losin', I go hard as I can go to win
I'm back goin' hard again, I'm shuttin' down my heart again
No one can get next to me, so they gotta put orders in
Try my best to act like I didn't care, but I can't hold it in and
I'm not into losin', I go hard as I can go to win

Da-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Think I only want one number in my phone
I might change your contact to ""Don't Leave Me Alone""
You said you like my eyes and you like to make 'em roll
Treat me like a queen, now you got me feelin' thrown, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
But I can't help myself when you get close to me
Baby, my tongue goes numb, sounds like ""bleh-blah-blee""
I don't want no one else (No, no), baby, I'm in too deep
Here's a lil' song I wrote (A song I wrote), it's about you and me (Me)

[Chorus]
I'll be honest
Lookin' at you got me thinkin' nonsense
Cartwheels in my stomach when you walk in
And when you got your arms around me
Oh, it feels so good
I had to jump the octave
I think I got an ex, but I forgot him
And I can't find my chill, I must've lost it
I don't even know, I'm talkin' nonsense
I'm talkin', I'm talkin' (Ah-ah-ah-ah)

2023,Moonlight,Kali Uchis,"[Chorus]
I just wanna get high with my lover

Kiss, kiss, looking dolly, I think I may go out tonight

The surface level ain't much that I care for
Putting on my lip gloss
I saw you stare from my peripheral, yeah

Find out how it feels to let go of everything, be free

Since I've seen that lettin' down your hair
Double-dog-dare look in your eyes
Oh, and you've been burnin' it at both hands
Been a hot minute since you flipped that switch
Girl, it ain't nobody's fault, shut the world off
And turn it back to when

[Chorus: Justin Moore & Priscilla Block]
It was you, me, and whiskey all night long
Sinkin' to the bottom of them country songs
Fire burnin' hot 'til the last drop's gone
Let's turn it up, turn it up
'Til we take that Black Label buzz too far
And say them things that stay in the dark
Ain't nothin' as sweet, ain't nothin' as strong
As you, me, and whiskey all night long

[Verse 2: Justin Moore, Priscilla Block]
I see you still got that knock-it-back shot glass
Girl, you ain't missed a beat
You already let a little four lettеr slip
And your hands are all over me
And you'rе already talkin' dirty and it's only 10:30
We know where it goes from here

2023,I Wrote The Book,Morgan Wallen,"[Verse 1]
When it comes to hitchin' the boat up
Backin' down the ramp in my old truck
To find a bunch of logs
To catch a bunch of hogs
Yeah, I wrote the book
Yeah, I wrote the book

[Verse 2]
If you wanna learn to throw a curve right
To catch a clean up lookin' on a third strike
Talk a little smack while he's walkin' back
Yeah, I wrote the book

[Chorus]
But there's one that lays by the lamp on the nightstand
One that says don't cuss and don't fight
Or let the bottle turn you into a different man
But damn if I don't do it every Friday night
Those get you into Heaven letters in red
Ain't gettin' read enough to keep me on a straight line
I'm a Jack of all trades but man I gotta say
That's one book I didn't write

[Verse 3]
I met a good girl she had her life straight
She said she loved that I was good at everythin'
One day she left me in a cloud of dust
'Cause I never was too good at pickin' up
[Chorus]
The one that lays by the lamp on the nightstand
The one that says don't cuss and don't fight
Or let the bottle turn you into a different man
But damn if I don't do it every Friday night
Those get you into Heaven letters in red
Ain't gettin' read enough to keep me on a straight line
I'm a Jack of all trades but man I gotta say
That's one book I didn't write

[Bridge]
Yeah, the good Lord knows I need it
I didn't write it but I probably oughta read it

[Chorus]
The one that lays by the lamp on the nightstand
One that says don't cuss and don't fight
Or let the bottle turn you into a different man
But damn if I don't do it every Friday night
Those get you into Heaven letters in red
Ain't gettin' read enough to keep me on a straight line
I'm a Jack of all trades but man I gotta say

But memories serve our sweetest refrain, mmm

As you float away, I'm reachin' for ya

Easy come, hard go, then life goes on

Oh, I'd remember thе way that you put me first
And what a heart-wrenchin' shamе

2023,Man Made A Bar,Morgan Wallen Featuring Eric Church,"[Verse 1: Morgan Wallen]
I sat down on a barstool, like a dern fool
'Cause she walked out again
Bartender said, ""I got you, yeah, 'cause I, too
Have been in your boots, my friend
Opened up back in '85
Got me over my first wife
Been stayin' busy since the first night""
It's a story old as time

[Chorus: Morgan Wallen]
God made the world in seven short days
He said it was good, I bet it was great
Then God made a man, and man got lonely
He said, ""Please, Lord, if I could only
Have an angel to hold in my arms""
So God made a girl, His best work of art
Oh, but He didn't make no place to go when she breaks your hеart
So man made a bar

[Verse 2: Eric Church]
For some guys it's a good time, thе half price
Half dozen buckets of beer
Some say it's a cover band, that's a cover man
I know why they're here
Didn't go the way you planned it
Damn, the devil did some damage

Loses more than just a piece of her heart

All it takes is a downtown bar
All it takes is some neon stars
A little you, a little me
In the same vicinity and it's on
Everyone is the first last time
Walk away, then, we hit rewind
A little touch, a little buzz
Don't know what keeps keepin' it up

[Chorus]
Is it your heart or mine?
Is it whiskey or wine?
Is it somethin' in the night
Makin' us wanna cross that line?
Girl, we're playin' with fire
Love ain't too far behind
It's just a matter of time
'Til it finds your heart or mine

[Verse 2]
We say that it ain't no thing
We say it, then, the telephone rings
A hello, arе you at home
'Cause I'm all alone missin' you
Wе swear it ain't love, love, love
But you're there when the sun comes up
We swear it ain't love, love, love

I don't wanna call and talk too long
I know it was wrong, but never said I was sorry
Now I've had time to think it over
We're much older and the bone's too big to bury

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, isn't it a shame that it ended like that?
Said goodbye forever, but you never unpacked
We went to Hell, but we never came back

[Chorus]
I'm sorry that you're jaded
I could've taken you places
You're lonely now and I hate it
I'm sorry that you're jaded

[Verse 2]
You're not even willin' to look at your part
You just jump in the car and head down to thе bar 'til you're blurry
Don't know when to stop, so you take it too far
I don't know whеre you are and I'm left in the dark 'til I'm worried
Ooh, and it hurts me

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's a fuckin' shame that it ended like that
You broke your own heart, but you'd never say that
We went to Hell, but we never came back

2023,Everything I Love,Morgan Wallen,"[Verse 1]
I wish I woulda met you anywhere but where I did
Some old high-rise town that I won't ever go again
I wish we woulda rolled around in some old cab and chased them city lights
And hit bars I don't like

[Pre-Chorus]
We were listenin' to ""one more silver dollar""
Hangin' out my Silverado down a road I love to ride

[Chorus]
Wish I woulda known that by now you'd be good and gone
And you'd leave us in a cloud of dust
Can't you see what you're doin', girl?
You ruined damn near everything I love

[Verse 2]
I don't care how much they're bitin', I won't even crank the boat
Soon as that bobber hits thе water, girl, your memory starts to float
Baby, why'd l evеr take the bait and take you places that I love to go?
Hell, I'll never know

[Pre-Chorus]
I even took you to my hometown to meet my mama

Ayy, just thinking 'bout the way you make me feel
It's so, it's so real

[Chorus]
2 AM, the night still young
You live by the gun, you gon' die by the gun
Ain't no handouts for nobody
When I ain't had shit, they ain't offer me nothin'
When I'm quiet, I be thinking 'bout killings
A lot of niggas bitch-made, stay in they feelings
Saving these hoes, this shit here pitiful
All these lil' bitty bitches my chillens, ooh
And Mama, don't worry
You raised a gangster, I'm a survivor
It hurt me
Not being able to give you what you want since I was a toddler
Shout out to my pops for all the free game
Everything you evеr told me, it stuck in my brain
Real OG status and like to makе a change
Shedded tears writin' this, seen so much pain

[Verse]
All the sheisty shit that I've done, blessed to not be in no chains
Uncle killed me when I was young, Mama blessed the boy with the cocaine
Growing up, I ain't have no daddy, my mama played both roles
Been hard on a nigga since I came out the womb, yeah, the pussy hole
I was taught to trust none
Face your problems, never run
Lil' bitch holler she pregnant
You a lil' nat-nat, that ain't my son
Tryna trap me, know I had a glove
Fuck them feelings, slatt, I'm a thug
You a lil' dusty ho, you're the rug

But that's the place I wanna be after my last breath

Bury me in Georgia
Let me rest in peace

2023,Forever,Lil Baby Featuring Fridayy,"[Chorus: Fridayy]
I know you miss me
Who it's gon' be if it ain't me, lil' baby?
I'm in your city
'Cause I need it one more time
Might lose it all, I swear
I need it tonight, ooh, ah

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
How we get so deep so fast?
Bae, stop playin', I'll beat your ass
You be on some toxic shit but I cannot get off this bitch, I
Haven't seen you in three months, I miss you, can I see you, bae?
Every time I see one of your pictures, that shit drives me crazy
Girl, I know you miss a nigga
Especially how I kiss it
Message say delivered
Why the fuck you keep goin' missing on me?
Every time he get back in the picture, you act different on me
Ayy, tell that nigga we gon' have to share you, I ain't trippin' on it
One more time might be the best for both of us
Maybe we should talk about it later when we sober up
Maybe we should keep it goin', maybe we should let it go
Feel like if it's meant it's what it is so just let it flow
Got somethin' to handle so I'ma be here for a couple hours
Figured out you like them, my assistant keep on sendin' flowers
They got they own business, tell me why the fuck they all in ours?
Mama raised a lot of things but she ain't raised no fuckin' coward
We went to the moon last time, I'm tryna go back
We been doin' our thing for a while but they don't know that
I be buyin' you all type of bags but you can't show that
I be playin' the cut until you come back

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Thinkin' how we played out
Really I feel off about it but ain't never said it
We ain't gotta talk about it
They'll never know when I'm with you, I play a different role
Can't move off emotion, this shit deep now I got self-control
I ain't never tried to hold you, niggas try to high and low me
I can break it down in dumbest terms and show you how you owe me
Still try and back door me, I know how to go about it
I know everything but I treat you like I don't know about it
Wildin' in Skyami, we took shrooms and caught a different vibe
Bitches can't fuck with you, you the one, for real, I peep your style
I gotta get to it, I'm OT so it's gon' be a while
It feel a lil' better when I ain't seen you, yeah
